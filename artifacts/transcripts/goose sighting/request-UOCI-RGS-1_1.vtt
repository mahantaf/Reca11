5
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:33.680

11
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:14.139
JM: main area of the page. But I'm going to go past it for now and see what else is here. This is not a real government service, and you'll have to create your own way of registering geese. Sorry.

12
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.469
JM: Okay. List with 3 items, link home

13

16
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:51.980
JM: that's the way the important stuff on the page right there. So before we begin starting. Yeah, begin with the the process. I'm going to test out the slightly links list with 3 items, home link.

17
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.940

18
00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:13.209

Pat: So

20
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:25.680
JM: so what I'm doing now is, I'm hitting the tab key to go through the different links. There are not very many of them on the pitch. Main landmark. Start now, button.

21
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.699
Start now. Button list with 3 items, wildlife and biodiversity link

22
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:42.800
JM: so wildlife and biodiversity, cookie, banner, landmark, clickable navigation. Men open 2 different tabs, wildlife and biodivers which take me away from the page.

23
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:52.080
JM: But start page. It seems like the links are working well. So I'm going to start the field entry now out Mainlandmark. Start now, button

24
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.049
JM: busy, link, skip to main content mainland. I found the button

25
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.940
JM: start now by using the navigation elements

26
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.949
JM: finding the one button that I remember seeing on the page which was for starting.

27
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:20.269
JM: and so all I had to do was hit the letter B, and it took me right to the button, which is great. Now I'm going to explore this page. Select. Yes, if you like. These

JM: a

45
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:23.249
JM: focus mode, and it wouldn't go out of it to find a continue button. So I had to manually switch out of it.

84
00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:11.080

85
00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:15.260
JM: okay, Button continue. So I'm going to continue

88
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:49.170
heading level 2 finished the accessibility exercise. If you think you've found all the accessibility issues, link, take a look at the answers dot

89
00:10:49.610 --> 00:11:01.540
JM: or link record another goose sighting. Ok, I believe that's the end of the flow. So I have successfully recorded a mongoose sighting or a Canada goose siting.

90
00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:14.370
JM: and I think overall that works pretty well. There was some weird hiccup with the radio buttons at the beginning, and I don't know if that was the site or Nvda or me.

91
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:21.059
JM: but I was able to clear it pretty quickly just by going manually into browse mode

92
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:25.350
the other thing was I didn't expect the

93
00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:28.349
JM: data for the date field to be cleared.

94
00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:35.389
JM: I don't really think that's an accessibility issue. But it's just something that I wasn't really expecting to happen.

95
00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:45.679
JM: and so luckily I read the info that the field was now blank, so just re-entered it, and there's only 3 screens to fill out anyway. So

96
00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:56.689
JM: overall, the experience was very positive, and I would definitely use this if I were recording these. So thank you very much for caring about accessibility.
