78
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:23.920
Doug: when you submit the answers page on on that page. When, before you submit the answers where you're given the opportunity to make some changes, the labels need to be relabeled.

79
00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:31.930
Doug: One is called change cake. One is, and like to change the date just like change does ran together. And

80
00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.979
Doug: so we have some text cleanup.

81
00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:44.210

82
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:50.750
Doug: and I think there were a couple of things I mentioned as well, and I can't quite remember what they are.
