00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:09.720
Kevin: Hey, everyone! My name is Kevin. I'm a tester with fable. Today I'm doing a self-guided task.

2
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.219
Kevin: The task is called Record a do sighting.

3
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.520
Kevin: and the

4
00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.800
Kevin: slug is, you.

5
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.260
Kevin: O, see? Aye. RGS. Dash 7.

6
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.609
Kevin: The technology configuration that I'm going to use today is switch control on my Ios.

7
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.279
Kevin: You can kind of see on the screen there that there's a little

8
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:50.139
Kevin: cross hairs going back and forth. This is what I'll use, and I'll use some of the settings built into the Ios switch control software. The task today is I will be going on a website, and I will be recording a goose siting with some

9
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.319
Kevin: fake data. And then I'm going to go through that. Enter that data. And then, once I'm done.

10
00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:07.690
Kevin: I'm going to go try to change some of that data to see if the functionality and the flow works. Okay. so here we are at the starting point for the page, saying, record a goose sighting.

11
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.799
Kevin: So there are some links on the screen here. I'm just gonna check those links to make sure they're gonna be working. Okay.

12
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:20.710
Kevin: we'll go to environment countryside. There we are. Go back. That one seems to be working.

13
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:30.549
Kevin: And I was going to wildlife and biodiversity. Yep, you can see when I click on. Those those ones are active.

14
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:44.470
Kevin: not gonna go any further with the cookies or anything. It's not really part of the task. But I just wanted to make sure that those white guys were working. So let's start the process. It says, use the service to tell us if you like. Geese tell us what type of geese you saw

15
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.340
Kevin: and the date on which you saw the goose. So

16
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:55.129
Kevin: I think there's a start. Now, option here. I'm just gonna use my switch control to scroll up there. We are.

17
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.860
Kevin: Well, click, start now.

18
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.810
Kevin: So this is a very easy question. Select if you like, East today I do like geese. The purpose of this task.

19
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:16.980
Kevin: and then I'll just click on. Continue. Everything seems to be working fine. Tell us what type of goose. It was

20
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.730
Kevin: because I mean Canada. Of course we've got to use

21
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.279
Kevin: a Canadian goose. So right put that in.

22
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.530
Kevin: I would normally use my voice to type this in. But we're we're on a zoom call.

23
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.350
Kevin: My microphone gets disabled. So I'll just have to type it in

24
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:46.989
Kevin: spare letter by letter. But typically, I would use the microphone down bottom and use that to to populate anything. It's just a lot faster than going with letter by letter.

25
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.199
Kevin: so we'll create a can of goose.

26
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.379
Kevin: Luckily we have some word prediction here which is helpful

27
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:56.730
Kevin: to

28
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.950
Kevin: not seeming to want to predict this word. So wherever we go.

29
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:14.790
Kevin: so we'll click done to disable the keyboard. It's nice at the keyboard. Things come up for that option when I clicked on that text box.

30
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:24.520
Kevin: Okay, so now it's looking for a day, a month in here that I saw the goose. So let's go in today. See what populates.

31
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:37.829
Kevin: Oh, this is great! I love. This one date, month or year comes up. I love it when the number pad is populated as opposed to the general keyboard, just because there's obviously less buttons that you have to hit.

32
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:47.519
Kevin: So let's say today. So we are going to say the first day of March, which would be 0 3,

33
00:03:49.550 --> 00:04:00.169
Kevin: and I don't know if what the format will be for day am I who viewed afterwards? But you'll see. and then 2 0

34
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.950
Kevin: to 0

35
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.800
Kevin: to and 4

36
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.779
Kevin: looks like it's kind of like the example up. I probably didn't have to do that, but we'll see what happens.

37
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.060
Kevin: He likes it.

38
00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.649
Kevin: So here are some of my answers that it was before it says, Do you like geeks? Yes, I can have the option to change that.

39
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:33.330
Kevin: As I said, I'm using some of my scroll down options. I have recipes built in that do certain gestures.

40
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:44.829
Kevin: one being scroll up or scroll down. There's the other option. I can use 2 for somewhere you can actually doesn't seem to always work. That's why I had the recipes. It doesn't always

41
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:51.339
Kevin: highlight where you're going, where the actual here we go. There's a scroll command, too, so you can scroll up

42
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.390
Kevin: or scroll down scroll left scroll, right?

43
00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.210
So

44
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.380
here we are. So I'm actually gonna change the type of goose that I saw.

45
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:13.780
Kevin: Ask me to do that. So I'll click on the change button. And this time we're going to see a different type of booze. so we can change that. So I will change it to.

46
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.010
Kevin: I don't know any types of geese, but we'll just put something in

47
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.940
Kevin: green-headed green goose with the green goose. Why not

48
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.770
Kevin: to?

49
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.920
Kevin: And

50
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.030
Kevin: we'll call it the Green Goose.

51
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.709
Kevin: and we'll hit. Continue again.

52
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.390
Kevin: It's gonna ask for the day a month again, I'll change that again. So it's

53
00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.859
Kevin: we'll keep that for the same day. I don't think it matters

54
00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.960
Kevin: one

55
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.140
Kevin: the

56
00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.589
Kevin: and we'll do

57
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.700
Kevin: 2,024,

58
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.450
Kevin: or

59
00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.920
Kevin: I'll collapse that number pad and

60
00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:22.760
Kevin: continue.

61
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:36.329
Kevin: And there we go. It did change it. So I'm going to just review everything. It looks like all the answers are right in there. I'm going to. Then the last part of the task

62
00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:43.780
Kevin: is just to hit. Continue and send the application. Let's make sure that works too. and continue.

63
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:50.790
Kevin: There we are. We have a goose recorded science. Oh, there we got some nice pictures of some geese eating in a field.

64
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.069
Kevin: So overall, this experience was quite good.

65
00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:01.720
Kevin: My switch controls seem to work no problem with the web page. All the links were active. I was able to scroll up and down.

66
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:07.109
Kevin: change the data as we required, and then submit the application. So

67
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.460
Kevin: I would give this

68
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.640
Kevin: this website a good good 2 thumbs up for

69
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:20.879
Kevin: for accessibility based on the task that I was providing. And yeah, that's pretty much it. So I have a wonderful day, and thanks for watching.
