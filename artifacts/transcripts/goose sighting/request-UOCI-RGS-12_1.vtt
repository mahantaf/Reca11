6
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:06.820
Siena: So my task is to navigate the page and enter

7
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.619
information about the type of goose that I spotted.

8
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:25.300
Siena: So here we go. I will now navigate to the page. Okay, so I'm going to actually go to the top of the page here.

9
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:34.650
Siena: and I will navigate by pressing control option. Right? Arrow first. I'll see if there's a heading heading

10
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:46.290
that's awesome. There's a heading that allows me to jump directly to the information, and if I go to the top like.

11
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:55.399
Siena: there's also a skip to main content button. So I'm gonna or link rather. So I'm going to click on it. Hang on record a second.

12
00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:04.169
Siena: And it brought me right down to that heading as well. So that's that's awesome. Right from the start. There's

13
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:16.770
Siena: 2 ways in which I can jump directly to the navigation. I have the option of using the skip to main content, which works very, very well

14
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:24.939
and I can also use my navigate by heading command, which is control option. Command H.

15
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.990
Siena: To go to the, to jump directly to the heading. So both work equally well.

16
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.270
Siena: and that's great that you have

17
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:48.219
both on the site because it gives the user the ability to choose so, for example, I tend to like the skip to main content. But

18
00:02:48.560 --> 00:03:01.290
Siena: using the headings is equally useful for me and for a voiceover user, we have the ability to choose which method we prefer.

19
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:10.690
Siena: So I'm gonna navigate through the page. Use the service. So listen, Bullet, tell us you like these, one or 3 bullet. Tell us type of news. You saw 2 or 3 bullet the data which you saw the ghost.
