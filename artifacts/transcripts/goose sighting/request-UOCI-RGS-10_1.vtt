00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.640
caitlin: The title for today's self-guided is

2
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.010
caitlin: record a goose sighting.

3
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.709
caitlin: and the slug is

4
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:18.049
caitlin: UOCI. Dash RGS. Dash

5
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.030
caitlin: 10.

6
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:27.180
caitlin: Hello! My name is Caitlin. I am blind. And the assistive technology that I'm using today is talkback.

7
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.090
caitlin: which is android screen reader.

8
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:37.989
caitlin: To give you an overview of the task. Today I will be filling out a form about a a goose setting.

9
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:51.889
caitlin: And to give you an overview. How I use my screen, reader, I primarily navigate via swiping, swiping right to move down to the screen, left to move up through, up through the screen, double tapping to interact with any elements such as links or buttons.

10
00:00:51.940 --> 00:01:00.909
caitlin: And if there's gonna be a lot of typing, I'll be using an external keyboard. But if it's just a little bit of typing. I'll use it on on screen keyboard. We shall see when that time comes.

11
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:19.120
caitlin: I will warn you that the double tap. Gesture sometimes does not register that has nothing to do with the website or anything like that. That's just a talkback Quirk that I've run into. And I will also be holding my phone up at an odd angle because I'm unable to in share my internal audio with Zoom.

12
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.600
caitlin: okay, let's get started. I'm gonna swip to the right

13
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.719
caitlin: link, skip to main content. Link is. It's not a real government service, and it's training purpose. Only

14
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.750
caitlin: good is not real service training purposes. Only you'll have to create your own way of drinking. Sorry

15
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.120
caitlin: you have to create your own way of registering geese.

16
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.319
caitlin: link one free for items, home link, environment and countryside

17
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.920
caitlin: environment and countryside link. I like Microsoft

18
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.280
caitlin: Link, free wildlife and biodiversity link.

19
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:59.500
caitlin: Anyone recorded goose signing.

20
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.960
caitlin: But start now, button. Okay, so far, this is perfectly accessible. Let's double tap

21
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.499
caitlin: 0% progress or 51%

22
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.310
caitlin: love you.

23
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.830
caitlin: Page is loaded. Let's swipe right

24
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.279
caitlin: doing content. I'm curious if this top part is actually change. So let's look over the web page.

25
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:26.469
caitlin: Okay, cool. We didn't have any of the previous links. That's perfectly fine. Do you like east heading level one so like you asked if you like East

26
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.099
caitlin: Select? Yes, if you like. Geese. Gotcha

27
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.629
caitlin: option one, too. Not checked. Yes.

28
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:38.870
caitlin: yes, no. So let's check make sure we can check both

29
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.880
caitlin: in group option 2 with 2 no.

30
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.709
caitlin: in group. I'll tell you what to? Yes, not check.

31
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.860
caitlin: Okay, yes, gotcha.

32
00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.900
caitlin: No. I'm kind of neutral towards skis. I don't like them and dislike them. So I'll just put yes.

33
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.139
caitlin: in group option 202.

34
00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:12.149
caitlin: No, continue. Continue. Continue button. The special instructors. Instructions did say I could explore the links. I'm gonna make sure there's nothing else on this page. Nope, okay, because we veered into the annotation for the zoom controls. That is the end of the web page perfect.

35
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.750
caitlin: That's switch our close tabs. Give it a second.

36
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.150
caitlin: Continue

37
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:27.790
caitlin: that has nothing to do with the website. That was talkback closing focus for no apparent reason. Usually, when swapping over from the zoom controls, it takes me back to the

38
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:38.450
caitlin: very bottom element or bottom location on the page, and it did not. So that's nothing to do with this page. So let's double tap on. Continue

39
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.520
caitlin: oop records signing with you.

40
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:49.909
caitlin: Alright, we're recording goose siting. It says record. This is web view to let us know we're on a web page. So let's swipe to the right content.

41
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.549
caitlin: Skip them in content. Let's try that double down. What type of 2 Cdc.

42
00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:01.649
caitlin: anyone? Okay, tell us what type of business it was. What type of goose did you see? Tell us what type of goose it was. What type of goose did you see anyone, those goose

43
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.690
caitlin: ghost goose? Tell us what type of it was

44
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.099
caitlin: I don't understand. Tell us what type of business it was.

45
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:13.270
caitlin: Eddie Box. Tell us what type of goose it was. Blacks for wink. Tell us what goes gooons? Oh, this is interesting. Okay, cdc.

46
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.680
caitlin: anyone. So I see the word ghost goose. I don't know what that means. Tell us what type of it was

47
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:32.280
caitlin: might be an example, goose continue.

48
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:38.010
caitlin: Maybe that's just an example. Alternative filling options available. Backspace

49
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.130
caitlin: windows. Sounds on keyboard.

50
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:51.350
caitlin: Bye? Bye. okay, yeah, there's there's nothing to type. There's nothing to type in there. So must be an example. That's perfectly fine. The ghost goose kind of threw me, though that was kind of funny. I think I'm gonna type it. I saw a ghost goose

51
00:04:52.180 --> 00:05:08.639
caitlin: wait. But if I type that, then then I can't change my answer to that. Okay, let's just type I don't know any types of goosees, so I apologize. But I'm just gonna make something up. I don't know what it said. Black Spurgoo. So let's just say, black pink

52
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.870
caitlin: goose, how do you smoke? Goose? Okay. Doesn't seem a spell.

53
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.809
caitlin: I'm awful at spelling. I apologize if I spelled that wrong, and

54
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.650
caitlin: I'll kind of fill up and talk back. Did not

55
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:29.149
caitlin: catch that alright? So let's touch some random screen. Tell us what type? Editing.

56
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:45.870
caitlin: The reason why I had to touch touch somewhere in the middle of the screen is because once when I turned off my Bluetooth keyboard the on-screen keyboard pop back up and talkback focus would now be in the keyboard. Tell us what type focus it was

57
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:52.839
caitlin: editing. I think it was alright perfect. That's what it wrote. Can you? Let's double-tap on continue

58
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.880
caitlin: 0% progress bar, keep working 20%.

59
00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.509
caitlin: When did you see the dews records signing?

60
00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.029
caitlin: When did you see the goose get the main content. When did you see the goose?

61
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:07.930
caitlin: Anyone, for example, April 1617,

62
00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:13.969
caitlin: and a Box day box on a box day?

63
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:21.389
caitlin: I'll try different options available about the keyboard. Use standard keyboard. No, I will use the external keyboard, because numbers are fairly easy.

64
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:28.289
caitlin: to type. I run my finger across the screen when I find the letter number that I want, I lift and it types it.

65
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:34.689
caitlin: 4 windows sounds 24, 7. Here, for example.

66
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.569
caitlin: Wednesday, edit. On Box day.

67
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.860
caitlin:  36. Window, Samsung free.

68
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:44.740
caitlin: 0

69
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.370
caitlin: 8 0 0 and a fuel.

70
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:52.969
caitlin: The reason why I press 0 and lifted sometimes if you lift

71
00:06:53.060 --> 00:07:01.709
caitlin: wrong, if you left a little too weird it doesn't enter the number. I've noticed that, especially with the with the 0. I'm not sure why that is, that's talkback work.

72
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.340
caitlin: When did you see the news?

73
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:10.649
caitlin: Anyone? Okay, it touched in the middle top of the screen. Don't wanna swipe, for example, 30.

74
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.039
caitlin: Okay. Perfect. Does editing 30.

89
00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:05.319

95
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:40.969
caitlin: random words in these links, because that makes no sense. I would expect something like change or answer

96

100
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:23.960
caitlin: Nothing. This doesn't actually do or block anything. You'll have to store your own goose records. Unfortunately.

101
00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:28.539
caitlin: Okay, perfect. Expand it. What happens with my data? Let's go for my email.

106
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:43.950
caitlin: Like, let's change this to 0%. Okay, 20%.

107
00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:45.229
caitlin: Oh, I can do signing.

108
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.899
caitlin: Yep! What type of goose goes? Tell us what type of news it was

109
00:09:48.690 --> 00:10:02.410
caitlin: that makes me laugh. I don't know if that bit of text is supposed to be there. But I think it's funny

110
00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.450
caitlin: lines what characters teach.

111
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:10.500
caitlin: Oh, St, okay. I thought it was missed. Right? Tell us what type any box tell us what type of this it was black for winks.

112
00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:14.870
caitlin: alternative filling options available about the keyboard. Think what you ask, Rachel use, and our keyboard

113
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.270
caitlin: windows sounds cheap. Hmm.

114
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.870
caitlin: thanks, sir. Go, sir. Okay, no.

115
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:30.520
caitlin: That face let me just face. That's nice. Let me talk.

116
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.180
caitlin: Thanks for awesome.

117
00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:47.839
caitlin: That is why I don't like typing on the on screen keyboard. If you lift wrong, it will. Even as you're lifting your finger, it'll for some reason move to the next

118
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:49.230
caitlin: letter.

119
00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:50.910
caitlin: That's nice. Okay.

120
00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:54.240
caitlin: Oh, oh.

121
00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.630
caitlin: thank you. QW.

122
00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:12.280
caitlin: Tell us what type of cause it was, what type of goes. Did you see? Okay, anyone Cisco scoops I can actually check and make sure I spoke goose right? So how I'm navigating by word and by character is, I'm swiping up or down with 3 fingers, controls

123
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:14.620
caitlin: thanks.

124
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:20.080
caitlin: lines, words, until I hear the value that I want, and then I swipe down

125
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:28.189
caitlin: and then swipe. I think, up characters. Yeah, there we go now. To characters, so I can see how it's something that's felt. I step down.

126
00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:31.719
caitlin: Oh, SE, wow! I spelt it right? Yay.

127
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.650
caitlin: okay, so let's find the continue button.

128
00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:46.209
caitlin: Let's first make sure that ghost goose has been hindered. 20.

129
00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:47.859
caitlin: When did you see the goose recorded signing.

130
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.270
caitlin: When did you see the goose? When did you see the goose.

131
00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:54.100
caitlin: for example, day and a box month at a box day?

132
00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:56.229
caitlin: It took away.

133
00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:02.950
caitlin: It took away the day. The date. Basically. That's unfortunate.

134
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:04.040
Gotcha

135
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.230
caitlin: 0.

136
00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.559
caitlin: Continue at a box near

137
00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.269
caitlin: right? When did you see the news here? And a box here.

138
00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:20.060
caitlin: Talk. Friday's being weird. Thank you. Editing.

139
00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:21.540
caitlin: and it box on.

140
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.220
caitlin: I'll kind of 4

141
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.160
caitlin: windows. Have one

142
00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.250
caitlin: continue, and up here

143
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:42.070
caitlin: oh, something else forgot to forgot to mention when I'm using the long screen keyboard. The reason why I know things have been entered is because it provides haptic feedback to let me know something has been entered here.

151
00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:20.739
caitlin: Get the main content. Check around details like, okay, goose details. And all 3, you like east

caitlin: Take a look at the answers.

161
00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:30.869
caitlin: or if you want to have another check, go back. If you want to have another check, go back to the start in to start. that should be it. Let me look at the instructions.

162
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:36.339
caitlin: Okay, submit your application. The task ends here. Okay, I have submitted it.

163
00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:50.889
caitlin: The only bit of feedback I would suggest is, if the continue button on the previous page to submit. This application is actually labeled, Submit, then it should be labeled, Submit because continue made it sound like there was more application to do.

164
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:58.760
caitlin: But that's honestly the only bit of feedback that I have for you. Everything else was perfectly accessible, and it made sense.

165
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:04.109
caitlin:  yeah. So you know, headings, links, edit fields.

166
00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:06.989
buttons. The little expandable.

167
00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:17.530
caitlin: A question that made that made sense.  yeah, everything makes sense. So this appears to be perfectly accessible.

168
00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:22.970
caitlin: At least everything that I interacted with was the skip to link work perfectly. So, yeah.

169
00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:30.500
caitlin: thank you very much for allowing me to follow my thoughts on feedback. Thank you for your continued commitment to accessibility and thanks for listening.
