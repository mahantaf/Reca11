Hello, my name is Camil.

1
00:00:05.365 --> 00:00:08.485
I am doing the task of recording Goose sighting

2
00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:13.425
with a slug of u

3
00:00:14.085 --> 00:00:18.345
um, UOCI dash ROC

4
00:00:18.345 --> 00:00:19.385
dash 14.

5
00:00:20.585 --> 00:00:24.945
I believe that's correct, yes. Uh, UOI. Yes, sorry.

6
00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:28.825
Um, and uh, again, my name is Camille

7
00:00:29.765 --> 00:00:34.145
and uh, pretty much I'm doing the task of,

8
00:00:34.645 --> 00:00:37.145
uh, just going through a quiz

9
00:00:37.485 --> 00:00:41.805
and, uh, editing an answer, uh,

10
00:00:41.945 --> 00:00:44.325
on a type of goose when I get toward the end.

11
00:00:44.905 --> 00:00:47.925
And of course, in the meantime, uh, describing

12
00:00:48.595 --> 00:00:50.565
what issues I have.

13
00:00:51.345 --> 00:00:53.165
And speaking of accessibility,

14
00:00:54.125 --> 00:00:57.685
I will be using an onscreen keyboard for navigation

15
00:00:58.885 --> 00:01:02.475
along with the occasional usage of a magnifier lens

16
00:01:03.015 --> 00:01:04.635
to see the webpage easier.

17
00:01:05.255 --> 00:01:07.275
And those are my two accessibility

18
00:01:08.515 --> 00:01:11.195
features on a Windows 11 desktop.

19
00:01:12.055 --> 00:01:13.315
So let's get started.

20
00:01:13.935 --> 00:01:17.035
I'm gonna minimize my little cheat sheet here.

21
00:01:17.415 --> 00:01:20.115
So there we go. I'm on your page

22
00:01:21.685 --> 00:01:23.865
and we're supposed to click on start now.

23
00:01:23.925 --> 00:01:27.905
So I'm gonna tab over to it

24
00:01:28.285 --> 00:01:30.185
and, sorry, forgot.

25
00:01:30.185 --> 00:01:32.225
Focus on the page. Okay, let's try again.

26
00:01:32.485 --> 00:01:37.425
So we're gonna tab over and it says skip to main content.

27
00:01:38.485 --> 00:01:43.465
So if I press enter, I'm not sure where it went. Okay.

28
00:01:43.885 --> 00:01:44.985
Ah, there it is. Okay.

29
00:01:45.085 --> 00:01:49.055
So somehow skip to main content.

30
00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:53.415
Oh, I see. Okay. Yeah, I should have pressed, uh,

31
00:01:54.385 --> 00:01:58.455
I guess enter to skip to main contest at that point.

32
00:01:58.735 --> 00:02:00.295
I dunno where the focus is,

33
00:02:00.635 --> 00:02:04.415
but if I press tab once, uh,

34
00:02:04.445 --> 00:02:08.575
this focus goes on the store now button, which is great,

35
00:02:09.365 --> 00:02:13.305
also great is that the, uh, there's no

36
00:02:14.195 --> 00:02:17.905
fancy border, it just literally turns it in.

37
00:02:18.365 --> 00:02:22.185
The green start now button turns into a yellow button

38
00:02:22.235 --> 00:02:24.025
where when I am un focus.

39
00:02:24.205 --> 00:02:27.765
So that is absolutely awesome and great.

40
00:02:28.385 --> 00:02:32.705
Uh, you, you know, it's a color change for me.

41
00:02:32.805 --> 00:02:36.735
That's perfect. I don't have to, I don't have

42
00:02:36.735 --> 00:02:38.455
to really look hard to see

43
00:02:38.455 --> 00:02:41.255
where I am focus wise, so, perfect.

44
00:02:41.635 --> 00:02:44.495
Uh, I'm gonna press enter and there we go.

45
00:02:44.755 --> 00:02:48.095
We start the quiz again.

46
00:02:48.105 --> 00:02:50.375
We're gonna tab, uh, skip

47
00:02:50.435 --> 00:02:53.165
to main content.

48
00:02:53.825 --> 00:02:57.545
I'm gonna press enter, not exactly sure

49
00:02:57.545 --> 00:02:58.865
where it goes the first time,

50
00:02:59.185 --> 00:03:02.205
but if I press tab again, uh,

51
00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:04.965
that might be a little more on my end, I'm not sure,

52
00:03:05.425 --> 00:03:07.245
but it does tap over Perfect.

53
00:03:07.545 --> 00:03:10.925
To the, uh, radio buttons to choose yes

54
00:03:10.925 --> 00:03:13.365
or no, uh, if I click left or right.

55
00:03:13.365 --> 00:03:16.845
Perfect. Uh, not only are they automatically

56
00:03:17.785 --> 00:03:19.205
filled in, should we say,

57
00:03:19.305 --> 00:03:23.025
but you can choose between, uh, yes or no.

58
00:03:23.445 --> 00:03:25.345
So we're gonna tab over one more time

59
00:03:27.235 --> 00:03:31.625
and actually tabs to the top of the page, which is not

60
00:03:31.815 --> 00:03:33.785
what I expected, but let's see.

61
00:03:34.665 --> 00:03:37.245
I might be just error on my part.

62
00:03:37.245 --> 00:03:40.465
Let's see if I press down,

63
00:03:41.905 --> 00:03:44.505
I am just going in between yes or no.

64
00:03:45.205 --> 00:03:48.025
If I do left or right, I'm doing between yes or no.

65
00:03:49.655 --> 00:03:53.755
So right now the only tiny issue is I have

66
00:03:53.755 --> 00:03:56.915
to find a way to get to the continue button.

67
00:03:57.135 --> 00:04:01.875
So let's see if I tab, it goes to the top of a browser.

68
00:04:02.095 --> 00:04:03.795
So I'm gonna just tab through

69
00:04:06.165 --> 00:04:10.455
and I am not finding

70
00:04:10.975 --> 00:04:13.915
a way to reach

71
00:04:16.885 --> 00:04:18.225
at least what I can see

72
00:04:20.185 --> 00:04:22.275
that the continue button.

73
00:04:23.055 --> 00:04:24.315
I'm gonna try it one more time.

74
00:04:24.535 --> 00:04:26.835
I'm on the skip to main content.

75
00:04:27.335 --> 00:04:29.915
I'm gonna press enter, I'm gonna press tab ones

76
00:04:31.185 --> 00:04:34.525
and we are on the questions again.

77
00:04:35.145 --> 00:04:37.565
Uh, I can choose the question up, down, left,

78
00:04:37.565 --> 00:04:39.525
right, doesn't matter.

79
00:04:40.185 --> 00:04:43.925
But I am not seeing a way right now to get over

80
00:04:43.945 --> 00:04:45.125
to the continue button.

81
00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:48.365
Uh, let me move the zoom out

82
00:04:48.365 --> 00:04:50.525
of the way just in case for something else.

83
00:04:51.725 --> 00:04:53.805
I honestly don't see anything else.

84
00:04:54.785 --> 00:04:58.085
Uh, I'm gonna try one more time.

85
00:04:58.175 --> 00:05:02.085
Maybe I'm missing something. It doesn't look right. Good.

86
00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:08.165
I'm gonna skip. Yeah, so, uh, right now we have a big,

87
00:05:09.515 --> 00:05:12.225
giant problem with, uh, keyboard navigation

88
00:05:12.615 --> 00:05:16.145
because I can find a way to get over

89
00:05:16.445 --> 00:05:18.225
to the continue button.

90
00:05:19.065 --> 00:05:23.055
I can choose the answer again,

91
00:05:23.055 --> 00:05:26.175
highlights in yellow, no problems there,

92
00:05:26.555 --> 00:05:30.895
but I have no way of

93
00:05:32.565 --> 00:05:34.415
getting over to the continue button.

94
00:05:34.515 --> 00:05:38.245
And I tried every, uh,

95
00:05:39.495 --> 00:05:41.375
keyboard command when I know.

96
00:05:41.515 --> 00:05:43.615
So that's a major problem.

97
00:05:44.195 --> 00:05:46.935
Uh, thankfully I can't use a mouse,

98
00:05:47.435 --> 00:05:50.735
but again, for pure keyboard navigation, uh,

99
00:05:50.865 --> 00:05:52.415
definitely needs to be fixed.

100
00:05:53.355 --> 00:05:56.495
So we're gonna press, I'm gonna click on continue.

101
00:05:58.965 --> 00:06:03.265
Ironically, when I did click, it did change to yellow, so

102
00:06:03.265 --> 00:06:06.155
that's interesting.

103
00:06:06.905 --> 00:06:08.715
Something I noticed. That's interesting

104
00:06:08.715 --> 00:06:12.695
because I would've thought they would've just kept

105
00:06:13.545 --> 00:06:15.055
being green on y yellow.

106
00:06:15.235 --> 00:06:20.105
So maybe there is a way, I don't know

107
00:06:20.105 --> 00:06:22.825
what fight on this question on, uh, what type

108
00:06:22.825 --> 00:06:23.905
of groups did I see?

109
00:06:24.615 --> 00:06:28.805
Fill in a blank. So I'm gonna tab over to it again.

110
00:06:29.155 --> 00:06:30.205
Skip for main content.

111
00:06:30.625 --> 00:06:32.525
Yes, tab over once,

112
00:06:35.405 --> 00:06:37.055
took a few tabs,

113
00:06:37.475 --> 00:06:40.455
but see if I tab backwards.

114
00:06:43.705 --> 00:06:48.315
Yeah, so, um, skip to main content feels like there's, uh,

115
00:06:49.595 --> 00:06:52.015
you have to tab twice to actually get to where you go,

116
00:06:52.195 --> 00:06:56.055
but that's not minor, that's minor compared to the,

117
00:06:56.715 --> 00:06:58.475
you know, on the previous question

118
00:06:58.475 --> 00:07:00.275
where I couldn't get to the continue button.

119
00:07:00.775 --> 00:07:05.035
So right now I'm in the, uh, um, I'm in the section

120
00:07:05.035 --> 00:07:08.635
where you type in your answer, uh, again in lighted yellow

121
00:07:08.775 --> 00:07:10.235
so I know exactly where I am.

122
00:07:11.115 --> 00:07:12.705
Super I'm at because, uh,

123
00:07:13.175 --> 00:07:17.505
even though it's a white background, ERO is distinct

124
00:07:17.805 --> 00:07:21.105
and I don't have to guess where I am in focus.

125
00:07:21.805 --> 00:07:23.585
So we're gonna type in a goose.

126
00:07:25.865 --> 00:07:30.435
I'm gonna type in a

127
00:07:31.575 --> 00:07:35.175
great goose and whoops, sorry.

128
00:07:36.195 --> 00:07:40.635
All right. And I do, I think I lost focus.

129
00:07:41.305 --> 00:07:43.635
Nope, sorry, that's my error. Sorry.

130
00:07:44.055 --> 00:07:45.955
Um, focus is still good.

131
00:07:47.155 --> 00:07:50.905
I might be misspelling the type of goose,

132
00:07:51.045 --> 00:07:54.105
but that really doesn't count for this task.

133
00:07:54.685 --> 00:07:57.305
So I typed in the goose

134
00:07:58.085 --> 00:08:00.985
and let's see if I can get over to the continue button

135
00:08:01.215 --> 00:08:03.275
with just the keyboard.

136
00:08:04.835 --> 00:08:08.585
And this time I did, which is strange.

137
00:08:08.685 --> 00:08:10.025
So it seems like the problem

138
00:08:10.605 --> 00:08:13.145
so far was just question number one.

139
00:08:13.985 --> 00:08:16.105
Question number two did go where it needs to go, but,

140
00:08:17.665 --> 00:08:19.325
but continue button tone yet.

141
00:08:19.585 --> 00:08:22.565
So that's where I'm assuming the focus is.

142
00:08:22.625 --> 00:08:26.795
And if I press enter, perfect, we go to the next question.

143
00:08:26.895 --> 00:08:30.755
So, so far question one had the issue of,

144
00:08:31.685 --> 00:08:35.145
uh, reaching continue with keyboard navigation.

145
00:08:36.405 --> 00:08:38.485
Question two was fine.

146
00:08:38.665 --> 00:08:43.345
So that's strange and disappointing

147
00:08:43.345 --> 00:08:47.735
because if, if I only had onscreen keyboard

148
00:08:47.875 --> 00:08:52.175
and no way of using a mouse, I would've been very,

149
00:08:52.395 --> 00:08:54.745
uh, up

150
00:08:55.265 --> 00:08:57.935
Upset would be the word or frustrated,

151
00:08:57.995 --> 00:09:02.015
but I couldn't do the rest of your goose questions.

152
00:09:02.235 --> 00:09:06.535
But anyway, we are successfully at number three

153
00:09:06.605 --> 00:09:07.855
with keyboard navigation.

154
00:09:08.075 --> 00:09:11.395
So when did you see a goose, for example?

155
00:09:12.535 --> 00:09:14.235
Uh, they give you an example.

156
00:09:14.535 --> 00:09:17.235
So we have to do day, month,

157
00:09:17.335 --> 00:09:21.085
and year, which is of course the European standard.

158
00:09:21.625 --> 00:09:25.245
So once again, we're gonna tab, try to tab over there,

159
00:09:25.795 --> 00:09:29.165
skip the main content, press enter tab one

160
00:09:31.285 --> 00:09:33.335
perfect day is highlighted.

161
00:09:33.945 --> 00:09:35.655
Again, it's a fill in the blank.

162
00:09:35.955 --> 00:09:40.715
Uh, wise, I'm totally fine with focus.

163
00:09:40.805 --> 00:09:42.675
Where I am, I can see fine.

164
00:09:42.855 --> 00:09:46.195
So with the keyboard, we're gonna type in the day

165
00:09:49.225 --> 00:09:54.065
and we're gonna, I'm gonna press the right arrow key

166
00:09:54.065 --> 00:09:56.145
to see if I can move over.

167
00:09:56.405 --> 00:10:00.065
I'm assuming not. Yeah, I didn't think so. So sorry.

168
00:10:00.125 --> 00:10:04.385
Uh, that was just my testing. So, uh, tab was over to month.

169
00:10:04.475 --> 00:10:08.605
We're gonna pick a month tab one over to a year,

170
00:10:09.635 --> 00:10:14.275
and we're gonna choose 2007.

171
00:10:15.015 --> 00:10:17.435
So, uh, we're gonna tab over one more time

172
00:10:18.095 --> 00:10:21.835
and I'm expecting it to get to continue hopefully.

173
00:10:22.825 --> 00:10:25.405
And yeah, this one does seem to get to continue

174
00:10:26.885 --> 00:10:28.375
with having any difficulties.

175
00:10:28.395 --> 00:10:32.735
So once again, just question one was the odd ball out.

176
00:10:33.195 --> 00:10:36.095
So, uh, I'm on continue 'cause it turned yellow.

177
00:10:36.395 --> 00:10:39.855
I'm pressing enter. And boom, we get to the end.

178
00:10:40.315 --> 00:10:44.925
Now I remember we were supposed to change the type of goose.

179
00:10:45.885 --> 00:10:50.015
So, uh, we're gonna try to tab over to the, uh,

180
00:10:51.075 --> 00:10:52.385
world where it says change.

181
00:10:53.365 --> 00:10:56.105
I'm on skip domain contest, press enter

182
00:10:56.805 --> 00:10:58.785
tab one more go down to change.

183
00:10:59.405 --> 00:11:03.415
Uh, the first change is highlighted, meaning for, uh,

184
00:11:03.855 --> 00:11:06.885
question one I just raised,

185
00:11:07.045 --> 00:11:09.005
I picked no for question one.

186
00:11:09.125 --> 00:11:10.965
I wonder if that has anything to do with it,

187
00:11:11.025 --> 00:11:14.445
but that's not the point in focus right now.

188
00:11:14.505 --> 00:11:17.245
So we're gonna tab over one more time.

189
00:11:17.465 --> 00:11:20.605
So I'm as, um, assuming it will go down to the

190
00:11:21.145 --> 00:11:22.685
change on the second question.

191
00:11:23.425 --> 00:11:26.205
It does perfect. So I'm gonna press, uh,

192
00:11:27.445 --> 00:11:28.885
actually I'm gonna press enter.

193
00:11:29.505 --> 00:11:33.125
We are highlighted on change again, clearly visible,

194
00:11:33.475 --> 00:11:35.525
even whether it's in white background,

195
00:11:35.665 --> 00:11:39.385
but a plus fair, uh, pressing enter,

196
00:11:39.935 --> 00:11:41.145
boom, breaks me back.

197
00:11:42.235 --> 00:11:46.875
Second question. Great again, uh, tabs to main content

198
00:11:48.005 --> 00:11:49.995
enter tab one more.

199
00:11:54.355 --> 00:11:57.955
Hmm, sorry. So, uh, oh, excuse me, we get

200
00:11:57.955 --> 00:11:59.795
to the fill in the blank.

201
00:12:01.765 --> 00:12:04.845
I have to admit, just a little personal pet peeve.

202
00:12:04.925 --> 00:12:09.495
I wish the, almost the previous answer was there, uh,

203
00:12:09.565 --> 00:12:13.835
because if, uh, yeah, if somehow I'd forgotten

204
00:12:13.835 --> 00:12:15.275
what was my previous answer,

205
00:12:15.795 --> 00:12:17.835
I might retype in the same answer.

206
00:12:17.975 --> 00:12:20.355
But again, that's a personal pee.

207
00:12:20.855 --> 00:12:25.835
Um, so again, highlighted on the fill in the blank,

208
00:12:26.095 --> 00:12:28.435
uh, again, you focus.

209
00:12:28.435 --> 00:12:29.675
Perfect. We know we are.

210
00:12:30.375 --> 00:12:32.955
So I'm gonna type in a different type of goose.

211
00:12:34.755 --> 00:12:38.535
I don't know much about geese, so

212
00:12:39.895 --> 00:12:43.245
hopefully I'm correct

213
00:12:43.625 --> 00:12:44.925
on that.

214
00:12:45.325 --> 00:12:46.845
Actually, I'm gonna change my mind.

215
00:12:48.085 --> 00:12:50.685
I type in this, uh, a blue goose.

216
00:12:51.425 --> 00:12:53.125
Yes, I know it may not exist,

217
00:12:53.265 --> 00:12:57.325
but that's not the concept of this task.

218
00:12:58.925 --> 00:13:02.635
Again, ta uh, I'm sorry, typing it in seems fine,

219
00:13:02.635 --> 00:13:03.835
just like the first time

220
00:13:03.835 --> 00:13:06.115
around I did this specific question.

221
00:13:06.215 --> 00:13:08.235
So we're going to tab one perfect

222
00:13:08.415 --> 00:13:10.155
and continue is highlighted.

223
00:13:11.595 --> 00:13:16.225
Press enter and we actually go to the second question, which

224
00:13:17.105 --> 00:13:21.605
I would've preferred to have a way

225
00:13:21.705 --> 00:13:25.095
to skip past the question.

226
00:13:25.135 --> 00:13:28.015
I went to go back straight to the summary,

227
00:13:28.955 --> 00:13:31.725
but it is what it is.

228
00:13:31.845 --> 00:13:32.965
I mean, it does work.

229
00:13:34.305 --> 00:13:39.045
Um, so I mean that would be a preference,

230
00:13:39.105 --> 00:13:43.565
but I do understand once you go to change, it will just,

231
00:13:44.415 --> 00:13:46.195
you'll have to go through the questions

232
00:13:47.525 --> 00:13:49.625
no matter which number you want it to edit.

233
00:13:51.695 --> 00:13:53.395
But I'm gonna pick at my time sheet,

234
00:13:53.455 --> 00:13:56.515
or I'm sorry at my cheat sheet to see

235
00:13:57.335 --> 00:13:58.955
if there was anything else

236
00:14:01.525 --> 00:14:03.305
you did need a submit application.

237
00:14:03.455 --> 00:14:06.625
Okay, so, uh, I guess I'm filling in the

238
00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:11.545
third question again for day, month, and year.

239
00:14:12.615 --> 00:14:15.085
Truthfully, I don't remember exactly what I chose.

240
00:14:15.995 --> 00:14:17.945
Maybe I do, let's see.

241
00:14:20.215 --> 00:14:22.095
I have a feeling it's gonna be a little different than

242
00:14:22.095 --> 00:14:25.485
what I wrote in the first time,

243
00:14:25.665 --> 00:14:29.045
but I could be only off by a little bit.

244
00:14:29.065 --> 00:14:32.535
Anyway, I sound gonna press stab once again.

245
00:14:32.635 --> 00:14:35.055
Go to continue highlighted. Perfect.

246
00:14:35.995 --> 00:14:37.735
We get back to the summary page.

247
00:14:38.235 --> 00:14:41.255
I'm moving on my onscreen keyboard to get out of,

248
00:14:42.035 --> 00:14:45.455
to see if there's a submit.

249
00:14:46.975 --> 00:14:48.715
Uh, the best of your knowledge,

250
00:14:51.705 --> 00:14:52.875
what happens to my data.

251
00:14:53.775 --> 00:14:56.235
Uh, there a continue button, which

252
00:14:57.575 --> 00:15:01.075
is not exactly the same as a sub submit button to me,

253
00:15:01.215 --> 00:15:04.495
but, uh, that's what I'm gonna go for.

254
00:15:04.985 --> 00:15:08.515
Let's see if I can tab over to it.

255
00:15:09.135 --> 00:15:12.035
Uh, of course I am on change, change

256
00:15:12.095 --> 00:15:14.755
and change for a third question.

257
00:15:14.975 --> 00:15:19.485
So one more tab should actually get me over to

258
00:15:19.485 --> 00:15:22.855
what happens with my data or data.

259
00:15:23.115 --> 00:15:25.095
So I'm thinking two tabs

260
00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:27.375
and I should be on the word continue.

261
00:15:27.425 --> 00:15:30.385
Let's see, once, twice. Perfect.

262
00:15:31.545 --> 00:15:35.665
I presenter on continue. And there we go.

263
00:15:35.905 --> 00:15:38.745
I assume that would finish the task.

264
00:15:39.285 --> 00:15:43.305
So with a nice little ose.

265
00:15:44.405 --> 00:15:47.025
Uh, so right now in uh, summary,

266
00:15:49.055 --> 00:15:52.465
that accessibility part of reaching, uh,

267
00:15:52.685 --> 00:15:54.025
the website was great.

268
00:15:54.565 --> 00:15:55.865
The focus was awesome.

269
00:15:56.185 --> 00:16:00.185
I could tell Zachary where I was on what highlighted item.

270
00:16:01.785 --> 00:16:05.925
The only major disappointment was with just

271
00:16:06.605 --> 00:16:10.525
question one, not being able to reach

272
00:16:11.355 --> 00:16:13.205
that continued button with the keyboard.

273
00:16:15.055 --> 00:16:18.175
I think it's most puzzling to me,

274
00:16:18.235 --> 00:16:20.975
but it was just question one and two

275
00:16:20.975 --> 00:16:22.895
and three were absolutely fine.

276
00:16:22.955 --> 00:16:26.175
The rest of the website worked fine with focus

277
00:16:26.355 --> 00:16:29.425
and just general usage.

278
00:16:30.555 --> 00:16:33.495
So yeah, the big, the big problem needs

279
00:16:33.495 --> 00:16:37.615
to be looked at is question number one of not being able to,

280
00:16:38.715 --> 00:16:41.415
at least I couldn't reach the continued button

281
00:16:41.445 --> 00:16:43.415
with pure keyboard navigation.

282
00:16:44.005 --> 00:16:46.855
Otherwise, yeah, everything looked good.

283
00:16:47.645 --> 00:16:51.495
Just let again, we are, you know,

284
00:16:51.645 --> 00:16:52.735
just question one.

285
00:16:52.895 --> 00:16:56.745
I would expect it not to work on other questions,

286
00:16:56.845 --> 00:16:58.905
but other questions we're fine.

287
00:16:59.125 --> 00:17:03.485
So that's the big issue it needs to get fixed.

288
00:17:04.485 --> 00:17:08.755
Again, thank you so much for letting me test your website.
