00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:07.080
Thomas: Hello! I'm Thomas. and

2
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.080
I'm gonna be

3
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.110
Thomas: your guide for today's task. But

4
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.460
the task is called record a goose siding 3,

5
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:26.830
Thomas: and the slug is UOCI dash RGS. Dash 5

6
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.940
Thomas: and today I'm actually on zoom text.

7
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.119
Thomas: I have a set to 1.4

8
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.449
Thomas: and have the color set to dark mode, and that makes it much easier for me

9
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.009
Thomas: to understand the screen, because light modes cause headaches for me. I also suffer from seizures.

10
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.899
And so I saw for dark modes.

11
00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:06.950
Thomas: and also my cursor is much bigger than normal. Zoom text makes it about twice the size and yellow in color.

12
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.650
Thomas: And so right now I can't see the edge of the paper or the edge of the screen.

13
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.630
Thomas:  and over here I can see.

14
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:28.190
Thomas: Okay, that's over here. So like, if I'm all the way to the left, I can't say I can't see I can see information about, but it cuts off right there

15
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:38.430
Thomas: and then whenever I put to the right side screen. I can't see record. I can see ORD, a goose siding.

16
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.089
Thomas: But yeah, it's basically the screens itself.

17
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.500
Thomas: But I'm using a magnifying glass to see the screen. That's the way I look at it.

18
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:59.100
Thomas:  but yeah, let's hop into it. And so first, I'm gonna just try some of these links.

19
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.440
Thomas:  and so

20
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:17.859
Thomas: this section of the screen's not dark mode. I'm not sure why that is the bottom half in dark mode. but for some reason this section's not white mode. Still

21
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.139
Thomas: and normally dark mode makes everything dark.

22
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.249
Thomas:  in this section as well. The top half of the screen is white.

23
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.190
Thomas: and the warm half's plaque.

24
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:38.059
Thomas: But I'm half the black one half. It looks pretty good, because I can see these are in blue. The

25
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:50.590
Thomas: boats and waterways and the coasts.  I'm sorry about the pause I just need. I needed

26
00:02:50.790 --> 00:03:01.210
Thomas: test clarifications. And so I'm just gonna click one more or so. Remember these. I'm just make sure they're visible.

27
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.310
Thomas:  and they're visible.

28
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.889
Thomas: But I'm gonna go ahead and start now.

29
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.360
Thomas: Tell us if you like, geese. And so

30
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.700
Thomas: yeah, everything's black. And that's what black, dark mode's supposed to do.

31
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.219
Thomas:  I'm just looking around because,

32
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.420
Thomas: okay, so

33
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.259
Thomas: let's say red.

34
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.520
Thomas: And they're. you know.

35
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.230
Thomas: goose.

36
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.990
Thomas: Okay, that's good.

37
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.410
Thomas: Okay, so let's go with

38
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.229
Thomas: today's date, 0 3 0 6 0 3

39
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.250
Thomas: zeros. Okay,

40
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.530
Thomas: this is the first problem. I see. Instead of

41
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:17.260
Thomas: you have to tab over or click over. And so normally, after you, input the date or the 16 4, you can 16

42
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:25.540
Thomas: 0 4. But it doesn't select it like that. It's basically an endless pit, that.

43
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:53.439
Thomas: yeah. And so this needs to be the individual date today just 2 days, and then switches to the month and 2 days for the month or 2 date for the month and 4 days for the year. And so they need to manually or automatically switch over. Once you start typing and you get to 2 numbers. That's the end of that section and the month and the year 4 numbers.

44
00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:05.120
Thomas: yeah, that make it much easier and much more fluid. For me. I'm gonna use the tab key to switch over. But

45
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:12.420
Thomas: that's just because.  my 24.

46
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.770
Thomas: Okay.

47
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:25.930
Thomas: Okay. Now, let's say, I want to change the red feather goose to a brown feather goose.

48
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.590
Thomas: Okay,

49
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:34.140
Thomas: this thing is erasing. Everything are typed.

50
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:41.090
Thomas: And I just want to type brown in the section. But since it doesn't have the red any more.

51
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.300
Thomas: I have to now type in Feather Goose.

52
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.920
Thomas: which is more work for me.

53
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.240
Thomas: and

54
00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.600
Thomas: there's messy

55
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.270
Thomas: goose

56
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:16.279
Thomas:  And so I think that if you could

57
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:23.100
Thomas: maybe make it to where all these things are filled in with what I had done originally. It'd be better experience.

58
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:24.580
Thomas: Hmm.

59
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.150
Thomas:  but

60
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:33.700
Thomas: 2,017. But since it's not

61
00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.710
Thomas: it kind of next headache for me.

62
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:46.279
Thomas:  But yeah, let me switch this to red for the goose.

63
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.229
Thomas: Oh, yeah. So yeah, this needs to be fixed

64
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.970
Thomas: alright. Well, it should be my eyes.

65
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.909
Thomas: and that there.

66
00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:58.000
Thomas: hmm

67
00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.369
Thomas: and I don't like that. You have to

68
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:09.360
Thomas: enter the date also cause I was just trying to change the goose. And I have to input the date again.

69
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.600
Thomas: And so

70
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:18.369
Thomas: they need to. Well, you guys should have them. Help me by remembering these things.

71
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:30.739
Thomas: Because I don't have to end restart all them. Or maybe we just have a button. You can click to redo everything. Because basically, you're doing that. You're redoing everything.

72
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:37.500
Thomas: Which is what you want to do. Or if it is, help me, just let me know I'm gonna use it all.

73
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:48.930
Thomas:  but actually let me try the change. What happens with my devil? Nothing. Okay. Well, since it's

74
00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.419
Thomas: I just kind of

75
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.440
Thomas: a try website.

76
00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:02.599
Thomas:  all the geese. Okay? So I think that I'm done.

77
00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.359
Thomas: Yeah, I'm done. And so

78
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:18.519
Thomas: I can't exactly think of everything I said. But

79
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:22.540
Thomas: the biggest thing was that

80
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:29.689
Thomas: is that saying changing just the feather goose color. I have to do the whole thing all over again.

81
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:35.689
Thomas: and I think that'd be pretty easy to remember what I input the first time.

82
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.809
Thomas: But it doesn't remember that.

83
00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:42.150
Thomas: And so I have to read it all as soon as I

84
00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:44.449
Thomas: click, I want to change the color.

85
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:47.980
Thomas: I have to also change the date and the

86
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:59.410
Thomas: all the answer. After that, actually, I'm curious. I wanna change the okay. No, I don't like yeast.

87
00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.460
Thomas: Yeah, alright. And so basically.

88
00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:13.790
Thomas: they're resetting, based on the item you choose to click on. And so I didn't want to reset everything. I just wanted to set the yes or no

89
00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:17.670
Thomas: and I know you guys shouldn't do that

90
00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:23.770
Thomas: But yeah. And so I did like the site.

91
00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.760
Thomas: I do like East.

92
00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:32.120
Thomas: but there are little things like the

93
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:41.659
Thomas:  Brilliant answers don't stick to the questions that. Yeah, it kind of seems like

94
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.699
Thomas: is lackadaisical. Him on mindset.

95
00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:55.309
Thomas:  But yeah, that's just my thoughts on the whole experience.

96
00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:06.780
Thomas: I hope you enjoyed this short but sweet experience. I appreciate you listening to me, and have a good day.
