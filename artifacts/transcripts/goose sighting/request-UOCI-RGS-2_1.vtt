00:00:02.905 --> 00:00:04.085
Hi, my name is Al

1
00:00:04.105 --> 00:00:06.765
and I'm an accessibility tester at Fable.

2
00:00:07.305 --> 00:00:10.685
Um, today the request title is, uh,

3
00:00:10.825 --> 00:00:12.325
record a Goose Sighting,

4
00:00:12.385 --> 00:00:13.485
and the slug is

5
00:00:14.165 --> 00:00:18.485
U-O-C-I-R-G-S two.

6
00:00:20.185 --> 00:00:23.365
Uh, I'm using, um, an Android phone,

7
00:00:23.485 --> 00:00:25.445
which is Samsung Galaxy Node eight.

8
00:00:25.795 --> 00:00:27.445
I'll be using OS magnification

9
00:00:27.585 --> 00:00:29.605
and Chrome is the browser for today.

10
00:00:30.145 --> 00:00:34.845
Um, so the task, uh, for the task, I will,

11
00:00:35.105 --> 00:00:38.005
uh, be answering some questions in a survey on the website,

12
00:00:38.665 --> 00:00:42.725
and I, uh, will try to, uh,

13
00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:47.805
complete the survey and talk about my experience as I,

14
00:00:48.145 --> 00:00:49.805
uh, go through the process.

15
00:00:50.665 --> 00:00:52.085
Uh, so let's get started.

16
00:00:53.965 --> 00:00:56.585
So as, as soon as I clicked on the link, it brought me

17
00:00:56.585 --> 00:01:00.865
to this, uh, website on this page.

18
00:01:01.325 --> 00:01:05.965
And again,

19
00:01:06.085 --> 00:01:07.605
I don't see a lot of stuff here,

20
00:01:07.785 --> 00:01:10.285
so I'll just explore the page first.

21
00:01:11.345 --> 00:01:13.565
So right now I'm un magnified

22
00:01:13.905 --> 00:01:15.925
and now I'll just turn on the magnification.

23
00:01:16.385 --> 00:01:19.845
Uh, for now I can see the big, uh, button, uh,

24
00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:20.965
which says start.

25
00:01:21.145 --> 00:01:24.885
Now. I like the size of the button just as soon

26
00:01:24.885 --> 00:01:26.245
as I open the page

27
00:01:29.895 --> 00:01:32.675
so I can see record a goose siding.

28
00:01:33.865 --> 00:01:37.245
Uh, again, the font is, uh, working for me.

29
00:01:37.285 --> 00:01:38.885
I like the size of it as well,

30
00:01:46.085 --> 00:01:50.065
so I like how I can just pinch and make, uh, a screen bigger

31
00:01:50.085 --> 00:01:53.585
and smaller because sometimes, uh, I'm not able to do that.

32
00:01:53.725 --> 00:01:56.745
And then I have to again, use the hand gesture of

33
00:01:57.525 --> 00:02:00.065
double tapping with, uh, one finger,

34
00:02:00.205 --> 00:02:02.865
and then it, uh, turns on the west magnification.

35
00:02:09.915 --> 00:02:12.015
So as you can see, uh, to read, uh,

36
00:02:12.035 --> 00:02:13.575
the instruction under it, I'll have

37
00:02:13.575 --> 00:02:17.805
to magnify the screen then so I can use the service.

38
00:02:17.995 --> 00:02:19.285
Tell us if you like.

39
00:02:28.015 --> 00:02:30.785
Okay. So it gives me some, um,

40
00:02:35.475 --> 00:02:39.525
some context on, um, how I can use this service.

41
00:02:40.065 --> 00:02:42.325
And then I see the start now,

42
00:02:44.285 --> 00:02:46.345
so quite straightforward till here.

43
00:02:46.965 --> 00:02:51.225
And then I see, uh, information about geese.

44
00:02:51.245 --> 00:02:53.385
And then, oh, this, this is great

45
00:02:54.535 --> 00:02:56.265
because it has links.

46
00:02:56.285 --> 00:02:58.585
Uh, I can see two links here. Reader

47
00:02:59.785 --> 00:03:03.475
Read about ease on Wikipedia

48
00:03:04.945 --> 00:03:07.765
and then visit the RSPM website.

49
00:03:07.835 --> 00:03:10.645
Okay. I like how they have not, they have mentioned

50
00:03:10.655 --> 00:03:13.925
where the, uh, these links will take me.

51
00:03:14.545 --> 00:03:17.205
So before even I click it, I'm aware, uh,

52
00:03:17.955 --> 00:03:19.685
what these links are about.

53
00:03:22.075 --> 00:03:24.445
I'll quickly try to check if these are functional.

54
00:03:27.585 --> 00:03:30.315
Okay, so they're taking me directly to the Wikipedia.

55
00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:33.955
Apologies. Uh, I had to come back, uh,

56
00:03:34.435 --> 00:03:37.515
'cause I had exit exited the testing environment.

57
00:03:38.015 --> 00:03:40.795
Uh, so I was on this, uh, Wikipedia page,

58
00:03:40.795 --> 00:03:42.955
which opened when I clicked on the link

59
00:03:43.395 --> 00:03:44.475
provided on the homepage.

60
00:03:45.055 --> 00:03:48.985
Um, I will try to go back to the homepage.

61
00:04:10.185 --> 00:04:12.715
Okay, so I'm back, uh, at the homepage now,

62
00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:18.015
and I'm assuming, uh, when I click on the other link, uh,

63
00:04:18.235 --> 00:04:20.535
it should, uh, take me to

64
00:04:21.435 --> 00:04:23.295
the RSPD website.

65
00:04:24.135 --> 00:04:27.475
I see a more link here.

66
00:04:38.765 --> 00:04:40.295
Nothing was mentioned here.

67
00:04:40.435 --> 00:04:45.325
Uh, I had thought that maybe it'll tell me what, uh,

68
00:04:45.375 --> 00:04:46.605
maybe some more options

69
00:04:47.105 --> 00:04:51.545
or some more links will, uh, will drop down

70
00:04:51.725 --> 00:04:54.705
and then, um, I'll choose where to,

71
00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:57.025
but it took me to a website.

72
00:04:57.245 --> 00:05:00.265
Uh, so not sure why we kept more

73
00:05:00.525 --> 00:05:05.295
and we didn't, um, specify the name of the page

74
00:05:05.295 --> 00:05:06.775
where I would be taken to.

75
00:05:09.275 --> 00:05:12.935
Okay, so, uh,

76
00:05:13.875 --> 00:05:18.435
now I wanted, uh, I will just click on, uh,

77
00:05:18.565 --> 00:05:22.035
start now and see what comes next.

78
00:05:27.115 --> 00:05:31.075
Okay. So it, uh, brought me to the survey

79
00:05:32.705 --> 00:05:35.605
and I like, uh, the font and the size of the questions.

80
00:05:36.145 --> 00:05:39.565
Uh, the size of the answer options, uh,

81
00:05:39.865 --> 00:05:41.165
is not working that great.

82
00:05:41.405 --> 00:05:44.645
I like how, um, the,

83
00:05:48.545 --> 00:05:52.925
uh, these, um, the,

84
00:05:53.385 --> 00:05:56.805
the place where we choose it is still nice and

85
00:05:56.865 --> 00:06:00.685
Big, but uh, the text is really small,

86
00:06:02.755 --> 00:06:04.815
so if you can make the text bigger here, I think

87
00:06:04.815 --> 00:06:06.055
that would be great.

88
00:06:09.075 --> 00:06:11.655
So it'd say select yes if you like these.

89
00:06:11.795 --> 00:06:14.015
So there are some instructions just under it

90
00:06:16.595 --> 00:06:20.695
for me that, uh, I know these are just some, uh, some

91
00:06:21.415 --> 00:06:24.135
instructions, but the font is really light for me.

92
00:06:24.995 --> 00:06:26.335
And if they are there, then

93
00:06:26.365 --> 00:06:28.015
anyways I would read them, right?

94
00:06:28.075 --> 00:06:30.455
So if they're a little darker, that would be really helpful.

95
00:06:31.955 --> 00:06:32.975
So I clicked yes.

96
00:06:34.555 --> 00:06:38.055
And here I also wanna see if I can, uh,

97
00:06:38.155 --> 00:06:39.775
use it in the landscape mode as well

98
00:06:39.845 --> 00:06:43.455
because it just increases the area, uh,

99
00:06:43.635 --> 00:06:45.855
or it just spreads out the text

100
00:06:45.875 --> 00:06:46.975
for me, which is really helpful.

101
00:06:47.595 --> 00:06:50.095
So yeah, I can use in, in both the portrait

102
00:06:50.155 --> 00:06:52.415
and the landscape mode, which I, which I'm liking.

103
00:06:59.135 --> 00:07:03.915
So the next question, what type of it you see?

104
00:07:04.055 --> 00:07:06.035
And then again, there are some instructions.

105
00:07:06.465 --> 00:07:08.995
Tell us what type of go it was.

106
00:07:15.245 --> 00:07:18.465
And I think that's the placeholder text is it

107
00:07:18.465 --> 00:07:19.625
just gives us a hint.

108
00:07:30.515 --> 00:07:32.725
Yeah, I'm just putting a random, um,

109
00:07:36.975 --> 00:07:37.395
answer

110
00:07:49.505 --> 00:07:50.565
and then I'll continue.

111
00:07:56.275 --> 00:08:00.195
I feel if we have any, a dropdown here, uh, with the names

112
00:08:00.295 --> 00:08:02.755
of the cos, that would be helpful as well.

113
00:08:03.015 --> 00:08:05.955
If a person is not aware, uh, it,

114
00:08:05.975 --> 00:08:09.035
it would really be helpful if we have, um,

115
00:08:10.345 --> 00:08:11.575
maybe names of different

116
00:08:11.595 --> 00:08:14.335
or different species of, of cos we have.

117
00:08:14.775 --> 00:08:16.015
I think that would be helpful too.

118
00:08:20.585 --> 00:08:24.845
Okay, I, uh, clicked on continue

119
00:08:24.845 --> 00:08:26.245
and it brought me to the next question.

120
00:08:26.755 --> 00:08:30.605
What did you see? Uh, when did you see the goose?

121
00:08:30.665 --> 00:08:34.165
And then it saves me, for example, 16.

122
00:08:34.435 --> 00:08:36.245
Okay, so here we have to put the date.

123
00:08:40.875 --> 00:08:42.685
Okay, the form fields are nice and big.

124
00:08:43.105 --> 00:08:45.485
Um, so I, I'll just put a random date

125
00:08:51.585 --> 00:08:52.685
and here I also,

126
00:08:52.685 --> 00:08:56.245
because uh, I feel it's a survey, so I'll just, I'll try

127
00:08:56.245 --> 00:08:57.485
to put, um,

128
00:08:59.905 --> 00:09:01.365
and try to see if, uh,

129
00:09:01.945 --> 00:09:04.645
the instrument can also validate the date I put.

130
00:09:04.785 --> 00:09:07.165
And if I can see any error messages too,

131
00:09:09.985 --> 00:09:12.435
I'll put the month as 13 as doesn't exist.

132
00:09:22.245 --> 00:09:24.815
Yeah, so I didn't see any error message here

133
00:09:25.355 --> 00:09:28.175
or, um, there was no validation of the date.

134
00:09:28.335 --> 00:09:31.695
I think, uh, adding that would be really helpful

135
00:09:32.355 --> 00:09:35.295
if accidentally I just type something wrong.

136
00:09:35.635 --> 00:09:40.485
Having an error message, uh, always, um, helps me,

137
00:09:40.825 --> 00:09:43.085
uh, you know, double check if I type things right.

138
00:09:44.315 --> 00:09:45.595
'cause I'm somebody with low vision,

139
00:09:45.735 --> 00:09:47.315
so I always tend to type wrong.

140
00:09:48.155 --> 00:09:51.685
Okay, so it brought me to, uh, the page where it says,

141
00:09:51.685 --> 00:09:55.365
check your answers, uh, before sending your application.

142
00:09:56.115 --> 00:09:58.075
Okay. I really like it

143
00:09:58.075 --> 00:10:00.635
because it just gives me that, uh, opportunity

144
00:10:00.775 --> 00:10:05.325
to double check what I wrote, uh,

145
00:10:05.895 --> 00:10:09.525
goose details, uh, you like, so it, it

146
00:10:10.705 --> 00:10:12.845
has the question and then it has my answer

147
00:10:13.225 --> 00:10:15.605
and then it has the link to change that as well.

148
00:10:15.825 --> 00:10:18.325
So I would say quite simple and easy to understand.

149
00:10:24.385 --> 00:10:25.665
I could see the change link,

150
00:10:25.665 --> 00:10:28.385
but if we can just make it a little bold, I think

151
00:10:28.385 --> 00:10:30.265
that would be even more helpful

152
00:10:31.385 --> 00:10:33.595
because I have to magnify more

153
00:10:33.595 --> 00:10:36.895
otherwise type of go that you saw.

154
00:10:37.035 --> 00:10:40.775
So I'll just try to add, add it white

155
00:10:46.035 --> 00:10:48.615
or as soon as I typed it, it brought me back to,

156
00:10:49.595 --> 00:10:52.695
to the survey.

157
00:10:52.835 --> 00:10:54.055
So I'll just put black

158
00:11:06.665 --> 00:11:07.995
and I just

159
00:11:07.995 --> 00:11:12.995
chose Sarah.

160
00:11:13.445 --> 00:11:16.285
I had thought that it, maybe I would be able

161
00:11:16.285 --> 00:11:20.405
to change my answer there, uh, just in that space.

162
00:11:20.465 --> 00:11:23.645
But it brought me back to that question in the survey.

163
00:11:23.665 --> 00:11:26.685
And then I have to take the next question again.

164
00:11:27.125 --> 00:11:28.725
I think that's a little inconvenient

165
00:11:40.235 --> 00:11:40.585
three

166
00:11:47.815 --> 00:11:49.755
and I think the same would happen if I tried

167
00:11:49.815 --> 00:11:51.675
to change any of the other options.

168
00:11:52.135 --> 00:11:53.135
And,

169
00:11:53.885 --> 00:11:55.865
And then now send your application.

170
00:12:01.685 --> 00:12:06.115
So I'm just going through, uh, the content under,

171
00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:10.565
uh, now send your application

172
00:12:12.805 --> 00:12:16.615
what happens with my data.

173
00:12:18.655 --> 00:12:20.385
Okay, so I see another link here as well.

174
00:12:30.265 --> 00:12:30.755
Nothing.

175
00:12:37.745 --> 00:12:39.235
Okay, so I clicked on it

176
00:12:39.255 --> 00:12:42.795
and the dialogue box just opened, uh, again, very close

177
00:12:42.795 --> 00:12:43.915
to it, so I didn't miss it.

178
00:12:44.075 --> 00:12:47.795
I liked that and how the, uh, whole link became yellow.

179
00:12:52.185 --> 00:12:55.525
So I just, uh, clicked on it again. Uh, just to close it.

180
00:12:55.645 --> 00:12:56.965
I was not sure 'cause there was not,

181
00:12:57.085 --> 00:13:01.185
I couldn't see a close button to close it,

182
00:13:01.245 --> 00:13:02.625
so I just clicked on that.

183
00:13:04.025 --> 00:13:06.425
I feel if we have a close button, uh, on this,

184
00:13:06.525 --> 00:13:07.585
it would be helpful too.

185
00:13:09.025 --> 00:13:11.725
And then I can just click continue.

186
00:13:17.065 --> 00:13:17.285
Uh,

187
00:13:23.645 --> 00:13:26.905
and it just gave me the message that the goose was recorded.

188
00:13:36.365 --> 00:13:41.285
Okay. So I was able to, uh, complete the task.

189
00:13:41.585 --> 00:13:45.885
Uh, I was able to, uh, to fill in the question, uh,

190
00:13:45.885 --> 00:13:47.165
the answers to the questions

191
00:13:47.265 --> 00:13:51.765
and also change, uh, the op the answer options for some.

192
00:13:52.225 --> 00:13:55.405
Uh, overall I feel it was, it was, um,

193
00:13:55.785 --> 00:13:57.445
the whole process was quite intuitive.

194
00:13:57.985 --> 00:14:01.005
Uh, quite straightforward. The contrasts worked for me.

195
00:14:01.425 --> 00:14:05.045
Uh, the design was simple and easy to understand as well.

196
00:14:05.505 --> 00:14:08.925
Uh, some things which I felt, you know, um,

197
00:14:09.915 --> 00:14:13.365
just based on the, the tech size

198
00:14:13.365 --> 00:14:14.885
or the font size for the options,

199
00:14:14.985 --> 00:14:16.485
if we can make those bigger

200
00:14:16.485 --> 00:14:19.445
because we, we have a lot of whitespace, uh,

201
00:14:19.445 --> 00:14:20.525
that would really help.

202
00:14:20.705 --> 00:14:21.885
Uh, somebody, uh,

203
00:14:21.945 --> 00:14:24.605
who is a plan screen manipulation user like me.

204
00:14:25.185 --> 00:14:27.965
Uh, and also validating, adding that, um,

205
00:14:28.175 --> 00:14:31.245
validation criteria to the dates would help again,

206
00:14:31.275 --> 00:14:32.325
because I tend

207
00:14:32.625 --> 00:14:36.885
or to, to, um, type wrong sometimes.

208
00:14:37.425 --> 00:14:40.285
So it, having that error message show up, uh,

209
00:14:40.285 --> 00:14:44.045
really helps me, uh, double check if I,

210
00:14:44.545 --> 00:14:46.325
uh, typed right.

211
00:14:46.865 --> 00:14:50.965
Uh, but yeah, uh, that was my experience.

212
00:14:50.965 --> 00:14:52.565
Thank you so much for listening to me today.
