00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:12.910
Noah: Hi, my name is Noah. And today's test is called record a goose sighting.

2
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:19.109
and the slug is U. 0 CI dash RGS.

3
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.379
Noah: And today I'm using a macbook pro.

4
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:33.190
Noah: and I am using drag. Naturally speaking, I am on a windows, 11 operating system with parallels

5
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:44.150
Noah: and my task today is I am using this goose citing website to record some answers, change them and just explore the page.

6
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:54.199
So I'm going to start by hitting the start. Now, Button. there's not much on this page when you're using the speech recognition software like dragon

7
00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:01.579
Noah: buttons that have text on them are very helpful, because I know what words to say when I'm trying to click on the button.

8
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.779
Click, start now.

9
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:13.049
Noah: Great! And so that worked the way I thought it would. So here I'm going to answer this question. Select if you like, geese

10
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.650
Noah: sure. Click! Yes.

11
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.010
Noah: again, this is perfect. I see the yes button. That's where I want to click. And that command works.

12
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.710
Noah: Click, continue.

13
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:37.589
Noah: So it's perfect cause we have. Yeah, all the buttons have text, and that's good. So here tell us what type of goose it was, and we have

14
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:54.169
Noah: a sort of example, a black spur, winged goose, and that's can be helpful, because if I want to click into that text box I should have 2 options. I should be able to click into there by saying, Click, tell us what type of goose it was, and click black spur, winged goose. So I'm gonna try the second option. See what happens.

15
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.000
Noah: Click, black, spur-winged goose.

16
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.670
Noah: click, black

17
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.470
Noah: click goose.

18
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.790
Noah: Okay.

19
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:17.260
Noah: I would have expected to be able to click in sometimes when you have symbols like the dash doesn't work. But let's see if if the tell us what type of goose it was? Works

20
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.260
Noah: click, tell us what type of goose it was.

21
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.310
Noah: Go to sleep

22
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.120
Noah: great. And so that worked so I would probably in this case not have the grayed out text in there.

23
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:42.319
Noah:  it's just confusing, because often you are able to say that to click inside. So if you're going to have the text there.

24
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:52.750
Noah: I would say it's probably I wouldn't use it as an example. If it's an example, I would maybe put the example below the text, box EG. Blacks for winged goose.

25
00:02:52.960 --> 00:03:02.090
Noah:  I would only have text there if you don't have text above because of space issues. Otherwise I would just leave it blank.

26
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.350
Noah: Okay, so here I'll fill in the only type of goose that I know. Wake up

27
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.070
Noah: Canadian goose.

28
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.410
Noah: go to sleep. wake up.

29
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.959
Noah: click, continue.

30
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:20.950
Noah: undo that

31
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:24.390
Noah: delete that

32
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.340
Noah: click, continue.

33
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.650
Noah: click, day

34
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.170
Noah: 7.

35
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:56.070
Noah: Undo that delete that numeral 7 press tab 11, press tab 2023.

36
00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.880
Noah: Click. Continue.

37
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:18.449
Noah: Okay. So here I have a chance to check out my answers before sending my application. So I we do have an extra link here that I'd like to try out. So what happens with my data? So let's see what happens here.

38
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.820
Noah: click, what happens with my data?

39
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:31.090
Noah: Okay, perfect. So that opens. Let's see if I can close it. Click, what happens with my data? Nice.

40
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.909
Noah: So that works well. So now I'm going to change the type of goose I saw. So we have the word change here.

41
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.480
Noah: Click, change.

42
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:40.700
Noah: choose to

43
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.660
Noah: click. Tell us what type of goose it was. Black spur, winged goose.

44
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.420
Noah: Click, continue.

45
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:11.489
Noah: Okay. So here I would expect, because I already filled it in that it wouldn't ask me again. So I would have expected when I said continue, I would just go straight back to the end part that I was at before. But let's just fill this in again.

46
00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:23.299
Noah: Click day numeral, 7, press, tab. 11, press, tab 2023. Click, continue.

47
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:26.740
Noah: Click, continue.

48
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:39.190
Noah: Okay? So that so it's recorded, I have my reference number. So let's see if there's any other links here that I can try out. scroll down.

49
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.899
Noah: click, take a look at the answers.

50
00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.120
Noah: Good! That works. Scroll down.

51
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.909
Noah: Okay, lots of links here. Click, submit an issue.

52
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.100
Noah: Yeah, I mean, click back.

53
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:08.969
Noah: I think this is pretty accessible. I think that these links work. There's no, I don't really see much purpose in me clicking through a lot of these links. Let me think.

54
00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:24.480
Noah: I really didn't run into any issues. I think a very mild issue was that grayed out text in the text box that caused a bit of a delay because I had to guess which word to save, to click into the text box. It would have been better if the words were outside the text box.

55
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:45.640
Noah: That's not really an accessibility issue, more of a usability issue. And we're actually run into any accessibility issues. So that's really well done. So thank you very much. I'm assuming a lot of thought went into creating that and a lot of iterations. And I don't have much in the way of accessibility feedback that I can give to improve it so. Thank you very much.
