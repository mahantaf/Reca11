00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.230
Marina: Hello! My name is Marina. I will be doing a self-guided task. titled S.

2
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.480
Marina: GT. Tracking your expenses with money manager 2

3
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:25.629
Marina: UOCI dash RCL. Dash 9. So I'm going to be going through a lot of stuff today. This is on Android with Talkback.

4
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.630
Marina: And

5
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.160
Marina: so to start. So I believe the first thing I need to do

6
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.239
Marina: is create sort of X-rays categories

7
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.560
Marina: and Pradesh.

8
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.409
Marina: Well, I'm on the home page. More options. But category. Name

9
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.489
Marina: your expenses this month. Total expenses bad expense, button, button.

10
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.260
Marina: double tap to activate.

11
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.860
Marina: So I'm on the home screen, which is like, I guess where it shows the expenses.

12
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:07.100
Marina:  and I guess from the get-go annotation. But at total you're academic more a month, 6 covin navigation drawer, button.

13
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.959
Marina: double tap to activate.

14
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.720
Marina: So just puts you on the screen and you first launch the app for the first time. It doesn't do any onboarding stuff

15
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.490
Marina: here, so you can kind of get started.

16
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.350
Marina: which I feel like that would be beneficial, because otherwise it would be difficult to figure out.

17
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.150
Marina: You know, how do I add these categories.

18
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:36.009
Marina: So in this case, then, I'm going to have to figure this out on my own with that and onboarding guide.

19
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.920
Marina: Anyway, month's expenses.

20
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.549
Marina: more options, button, double tap to activate, double, tap, and hold to long press.

21
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.160
Marina: Start by maybe doing, you know, puts on on that more actions or more. More more options.

22
00:01:50.920 --> 00:02:00.030
Marina: Pop up window your wallet, enlist, add income settings. annotation, button out of list, window settings, enlist window hub of window.

23
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.400
Marina: double tap, tap.

24
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:16.869
Marina: money manager, more options, monthly open navigation money manager checked month's expenses, budget categories, budget analysis. monthly expenses, analysis, budget plans, annotation. But but monthly budget is budget categories.

25
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.530
Marina: double tap to activate.

26
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:28.290
Marina: So rather than it being called expense categories, it looks like it's called budget categories. so that can be bit

27
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.710
Marina: confusing.

28
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.810
Marina: But anyway.

29
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:45.410
Marina: so like, I said in the notes that I'm looking at that looks like there's a lot of stuff. So I think what I should do first is back out of this menu

30
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.530
Marina: nova 7

31
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.469
Marina: zoom out of grid, right? So what I did was I pressed the back button.

32
00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.340
Marina: or I did the back gesture with top back and rounded, unclosed a menu. It took me back to my home screen

33
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.570
Marina: apologies for the pause. I had to

34
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.819
Marina: get back into the app. So now that I'm not able to close the menu.

35
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.350
Marina: I have to select something. So

36
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:30.730
Marina: bunch budget categories checked money, checked month's expenses. So let's just click back into month's expenses. Open navigation drawer, come on, 6 more options, button, and then from there hit the more actions or more options.

37
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:38.659
Marina: Pop up, window, your wallet in lit at an income double tap to activate. And I'm gonna have add in.

46
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.500
Marina: for the income. A $1,000, 4, with one.

53
00:04:52.910 --> 00:05:00.969

54
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:16.319
Marina: just my thinking. So I'm gonna double tap. This hopefully it saves the information your wallet contains. Now 1,000 point. Oh, keyboard, hidden money manager, open navigation drawer, button, double tap to activate.

55
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.420

56
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.849
Marina: However, it didn't even say, you know $1,000. So

57
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.520
Marina: it's like 1,000. What exactly to.

58
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.780
Marina: I'm not sure if this is something that's dealt with in the settings app, but it's anyway

Marina: months, expensive. More options, button category. Make your expenses this month. Total expenses add expense, button, button annotation button, add expense, button button window. So let's say, you know, totally new. With this.

61
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.630
Marina: is act like, I want to add something here to the expenses.

69
00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:58.039
Marina: you know how many characters are remaining, so I don't know what I'm supposed to enter in each edit box. It just tells me the character limit.

Marina: double tap to activate labels. Available. Use tab with 3 fingers to view.

147
00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:36.860
Marina: and it looks like we have an unlabeled button. I don't know if I mentioned that earlier, so I'm gonna use this to add a category budget category info category. Name, edit.

148
00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:40.140
Marina: Double tap to edit text, double tap. shit

149

00:14:54.530 --> 00:15:02.339
Marina: Bad income button. When to write the maximum budget, write the maximum amount of money you can spend in this category Eddybox. double tap, the back

153
00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.300
Marina: button showing number keyboard.

154
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:10.670
Marina: And then for this, since I want to write a maximum amount.

155
00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:20.569
Marina: Since we're thinking of something that can fluctuate over time, you know, because it's gonna include utilities and whatnot. I'm just gonna put in

156
00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:31.390
Marina: like, I don't know. 8 50, I guess. 5, 6, 9, 9, one. Delete comma 0 0 0

157
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:35.770
editing, 9. Clear text. Write the maximum on the ad income, button

158

Marina: double tap to active one. 1, 1 1. Write the map clear F, care housing at Budget Head.

159
00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:51.820
Marina: health care. We write them as them add in one window number, add income button window budget category info.

160
00:15:52.060 --> 00:16:04.649
Marina: So I'm not sure why this is happening. But that button where does add income? It shouldn't even be saying that because it's not the income screen. This is a budget category screen. So not label correctly.

161
00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.420
Marina: And the

162
00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:19.100
Marina: I think that's it for that issue, I'm gonna double tap. Oh, no. The other issue is that instead of it being called, add income, I believe it should be called. It should just be a save button

163
00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:26.139
Marina:  And then, in regards to placements, I feel like that should be like on the upper right.

164
00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:33.610
Marina: like there should be a save on the upper right, and then, if you don't want to add it, there should be a cancel button which should be on the upper left.

165
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:37.100
Marina: So I'm gonna save it now. I'm gonna double tap

166
00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:46.749
Marina: keyboard, hidden money manager, open navigation drawer, button, double tap to activate. We're gonna see if it shows up to talk back.

167
00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.869
Marina: you know, but talkback notices anything

168
00:16:51.660 --> 00:17:02.759
Marina: with this. You know, if it notices that I've added a new scene. or if it's going to treat it as an unlabeled item. Budget morocco category budget housing. Enlist $900

169
00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:10.239
Marina: unlabeled button annotation, button window unlabeled button window money manager. And again the add button is not labeled.

170
00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:21.240
Marina: and I feel like for that. That should be like on the upper right. More better, more options, button window money. Oh, no, that's not gonna work, because we have more options. So

171
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:23.229
Marina: guess forget that.

172
00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:31.029
Marina: But any rate, like I, said, the button to add, another category is unlabeled.

173
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.620
Marina: This is how it is. Let's how it was at the beginning as well.

174
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:52.670

212
00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.760
Marina: So for this

213
00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:34.089
Marina: we have ourselves here. Talkback is categorizing this as a Slider

214
00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:40.040
Marina: route around like some sort of either some sort of custom. Singh

215
00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:49.460
Marina: or Progress bar, or something. to give us an idea. And because it's categorizing this as a slider.

216
00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:54.579
Marina: technically speaking, or, theoretically speaking, I can adjust this Slider.

217
00:21:55.170 --> 00:22:01.609
Marina: 5%, 10%, 15% like so and I haven't even added anything. And I can adjust the Slider.

218
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:05.079
Marina: And that's not supposed to happen. So let's set it back

219
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:07.010
Marina: by 0%.

220
00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:11.019

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:19.570
Marina: $0, night shopping, 0%, $0, 200 food, 0% slight $0, $200.

222
00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.089
Marina: Alright. So looks like I have a

223
00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:26.589
Marina: I do like how this is coming along. I'm gonna

224
00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:31.430
Marina: hopefully find some stuff here. Total expense. Add expense, button button.

225
00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:37.599
Marina: There it is, I see, an add expense button. I do like that. This button is labeled as such.

226
00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:42.350
Marina: I'm going to double tap on it. Add new transaction product, category.

227

The characters entered 0 10.

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:54.630
Marina: So like before. It's a

231
00:22:55.630 --> 00:23:03.759
Marina: doesn't tell me what to what I can write in. It just says characters entered 0 a 10, so that tells me nothing.

232
00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:15.149
Marina: Enter info edit boss. double tap to edit test. Here. Enter info edit box. So for both edit boxes. All it just says is, enter info. So that tells me. Yeah.

233
00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:24.419
Marina: Doesn't tell me much. However, what I am concerned about right now is the product category drop-down list housing.

234
00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:34.270
Marina: double tap to change? Oh, yeah, that's right. So it already selected housing for me. But I'm gonna see if this works. Anyway, I'm gonna double tap on this product category dropdown

235
00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:38.540
Marina: pop-up window housing, enlist, shopping, food.

240
00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:57.839
Marina: Can I double tap shown English? USQW. VRTY. Okay. So

241
00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:02.050
Marina: I was gonna try, you know. Figure this out on my own.

242
00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.430
Marina: and we're gonna see what you know if

243
00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:15.149
Marina: it brings it the same keyboard on the next edit box characters and enter info edit box. Knock the back button showing number T board. Hmm.

244
00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:19.280
Marina: okay, so let's just do this.

245
00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:32.209
Marina: put in 600. Then for the amount cause it looks like this is an amount box. It says, Talk back. Decided not to tell me that I could. And you know that it's asking for an amount.

246
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:36.299
Marina: So basically like the edit boxes are not labeled correctly.

247
00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.490
Marina: I'm just gonna put in here. Space

248
00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:44.480

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:47.400

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.550

258
00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:41.969
Marina: But what we have below right now is this keyboard? So I'm gonna try to dismiss that

259
00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:45.920
Marina: showing number keyboard done double tapping

260
00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.680
600 edit box entered Info.

261
00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:55.280
Marina: the thirteenth of February the fourth of February 2024, the eighth of February, the first of February 2024

262
00:25:55.550 --> 00:26:02.070
Marina: double tap. So let's double. Tap this to see if it gets selected. Thursday, February first, 2024. Selected

263
00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.570
Marina: excellent

264
00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:08.569
Marina: speech. Read 161% speech. Read one, pardon me.

265
00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:11.350
selected the first of February 2024,

266
00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.770
Marina: so it does say that selected which is good.

267
00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:17.379
Marina: Now let's try to save it.

268
00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:25.680
Marina: Add transaction button out of Gager, and I was able to find it by doing my one finger. Drag it said, add transaction.

269
00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:32.410
Marina: Barbara. I would have liked it to be labeled Safe Transaction or just save.

270
00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:37.980
Marina: and possibly the other thing that would have been useful characters entered 4 10

271
00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:41.870
Marina: would be to probably have it on the upper right.

272
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:48.429
Marina: you know, like a save button and and a cancel button on the upper left. So let's save the transaction.

273
00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:51.469
Marina: and that transaction buttons

274
00:26:51.500 --> 00:27:01.539
Marina: double tap to activate transaction. Budget category equals. One product name equals. Rent. Price equals 600.0 by date equals Thursday, February first, 10, a oh, 2 Pacific standard time, 2024

275
00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:12.990
Marina: money manager, open navigation. So I don't know if you heard what it just said. But basically it almost sounds like technical jargon cause it said, budget category equals one

276
00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.650
Marina: when

277
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:22.899
Marina: and then it said, all this other stuff equals this and that. I think what would have been best. What would have been

278
00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:26.319
Marina: butter would have been to have it say something like

279
00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:32.120
Marina:  you know, expense saved something like that.

280
00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:37.469
Marina: So let's see if anything got effective here in regards to any sliders or whatever.

281
00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:44.910
Marina: Alright, so looks like I'm almost out of time. And so

282
00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:51.460
Marina: that's gonna be there's still a lot to do according to this task.

283
00:27:52.190 --> 00:28:00.219
Marina:  But what I want to do is see the Slider here, how that all works. If anything gets affected here, Shelby.

284
00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:04.539
Marina: 60 s housing. You're expecting housing 67% Slider

285
00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:21.309
Marina: swipe up or swipe down to adjust labels available. Use tab with 3 fingers to view. So it does say, you know, this Slider does change according to what you added. However, again, I'm going to emphasize that, for whatever reason you can change the slider

286
00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:32.590
Marina:  you can change the slider around, because, you know, Talkback says it the Slider. So you can actually fumble around with it. 62, 56, 62%,

287
00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:38.500
Marina: 72%, 67%. Yeah. So I wanna

Marina: food bedbox category name food. You cannot change the category name shown English us. QW. VR, okay, I don't know why it just did that when I double tipped that text box. It basically flagged an error so that I can't change that category name. But then it also brought up the keyboard, anyway.

298
00:29:55.060 --> 00:30:01.990
Marina: So let's see if I can actually change it, regardless of what it just told me. Billy's next delete

304
00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:40.660
Marina: I was expecting it to put the cursor at the end of the word.

305
00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:45.009
Marina: So let's just put it now. Recreation.

306

319
00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:50.979
Marina: So I don't know why that error came up the way it did. Why, I said, you can't change the name. I mean. I.

320
00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:52.860
Marina: Our train was able to.

321
00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:56.150
Marina: Now.

322
00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:59.229
Marina: I'm supposed to create a

323
00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:04.510

Marina: Hmm, unlabeled button.

328
00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:39.449
Marina: Yeah, I don't know exactly what that all means. So what I'm just gonna do is the unlabeled button. We have ourselves another unabled button. double tap, plan, info plan, title, edit, box.

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:57.220
Marina: double tap to have Tuesday, February 20, seventh, 2,000 planned deck plans, characters, and clandest friction. What I would have liked to see on this is

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:00.900
Marina: like, you know. give us a.

333
00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:06.859
Marina: It was like more details on what I'm supposed to do on this screen, or what's the purpose of

334
00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:10.010
Marina: having a budget plan? What's that supposed to do?

335
00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:21.150
Marina:  So what I'm gonna do just charging stops battery level 80%, just because we're almost out of time, or whatever I'm just gonna hook up my external keyboard

336
00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:27.920
Marina: so I can start typing plan, info, plan, title, edit, boss.

337
00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:36.029
Marina: double tap to edit text, double tap, and hold a longer. So for this, since I don't exactly know what this is for just gonna put in test T

338
00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:39.720
Marina: characters into planned description. Bennett box

339
00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:47.529
Marina: editing plan, description edit. Bob so didn't tell me that I was a editing

340
00:33:47.720 --> 00:34:00.240
Marina: when I double tap. So I had to kind of verify that. So empty it's gonna put in test. editing test edit box characters entered for test edit, box characters, plans, budget edit box.

341
00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:10.749
Marina: So when I used my external keyboard, what I was expecting to happen when I tabbed over, I was expecting to go to the next edit box dollar sign showing physical keyboard.

342
00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:16.760
Marina: So with plans, budgets, let's say, I guess we're like

343
00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:22.570
Marina: 500 or No. 404 0. Let's do 400.

344
00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:25.610
Marina: Looks like everything's in correctly here. So

345
00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:30.250
Marina: dollar sign, clear text plan, deadline date 2,024,

346
00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:32.279
Marina: yeah. Tuesday, February 27.

347
00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:33.570
Hey?

348
00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:37.839
Marina: Alright! So let's do this for

349
00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:47.040
Marina: the third, the fifth of February 2024, the 60'clock. This is the first next month, but in page 1491 of 2,000,

350
00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:59.120
Marina: the seventh of March 2024, the first of March 2020, Friday, March first, 2024, selected. Friday, March first, editing 4, and a plan. Friday, March first. Double tap to have to be

351
00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:11.370
Marina: the 20 sixth, the 30 of them march 2020. Alright. So I put everything in there and let's see what happens. I'm gonna look for like some sort of button to save it. Test edit. Bob's plan, info

352
00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:20.050
Marina: character tech character editing for dollars. Not clear text button, double tap to activate this thing says I'm still editing in that

353
00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:24.889
Marina: amount. So let's just see if I, pressing enter will get me out of that.

354
00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:37.550
Marina: Friday, March first. Perfect press all plus enter to activate previous month, Friday, 2,000 point planned deadline dollar sign 400 edit. Great. So I did add everything in it that I needed to add

355
00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:40.320
Marina: the 20 ninth of March 2024,

356
00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:41.870
stop, share button

357
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.730
Marina: the twentieth, the thirtieth of march, switch input method, button out of key share audio.

358
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:51.529
Marina: the the tenth of month test test, edit, plan it.

359
00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:55.129
Marina: stop, share share authentic switch in the back.

360
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.970
Marina: Beth.

361
00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:59.740
Marina: but it's great

362
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:11.919
Marina: right back here. But no, I don't want to do that. The twentieth of March 2020, the 20 ninth of March 2024 annotation button the fourth of March.

363
00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:20.050
Marina: Add plan, button out of cager, alright perfect. So scrolling up that actually reveals a button that native.

364
00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:28.850
Marina: Let's double tap it. Your plan added successfully. Keyboard, hidden money manager, open navigation bunch of more options. Your wallet contains enough money for this.

365
00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:40.989
Marina: Your wallet contains. The deadline, the deadline test test. Friday, March first, 2024 $400 in list. Unlabeled button out of lift. Annotation button. Untest test test. Friday, March first, 2024.

366
00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:44.869
Marina: Alright. So let's see if

367
00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:47.090
Marina: okay. So I need to create a

368
00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:49.119
which I did there.

369
00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:54.040
Marina: And now looks like I need to look at the analysis.

370
00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:59.459
Marina: There are 2 analysis results I need to look at apparently. So let's

371
00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:02.770
Marina: go. Bring up the menu. Your wallet, keep coping, navigation, drill.

372
00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:12.000
Marina: monthly expense checked budget like annotation button check monthly expenses, analysis, budget analysis.

373
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:20.119
Marina: double tap to activate budget categories, budget analysis. So let's look at budget analysis and see what happens here.

374
00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:29.809
Marina: Open navigation drawer budget and adds more with you. Pie chart, entitled Your Expenses per Category this month, with one points min. Value is 600. Max value is 600 article.

375
00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:37.020
Marina: any charge, trial version link, any chart. Javascript charts designed to be embedded and integrated. V, 8.4 point 2 dot, one housing.

376
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:41.020
Marina: shopping, housing, 0 over 0

377
00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:42.379
Marina: for more information.

378
00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:50.310
Marina: Visit our website. Annotation button window annotation. So even though I didn't have enough time to add

379
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:56.590
Marina: more to the expenses. It's still well, what I noticed is, it's not exactly.

380
00:37:56.750 --> 00:38:08.870
Marina: that useful! I would prefer to look over like the actual data within the month's expenses. Tab as opposed to a church.

381
00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:13.970
Marina: Let's see about the budget plan one open navigation

382
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:15.659
Marina: and money manager

383
00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:26.490
Marina: month's expenses. Budget check, but monthly expenses. Analysis checked budget analysis. Oh, so this was budget analysis. So yeah, that one's kind of interesting.

384
00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:36.770
Marina: Let's look at that monthly expenses, another one monthly expenses, and see what happens here. Check open navigation drawer monthly, Morosh, with you.

385
00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:43.940
Marina: Annotation button window, Webview window money manager. Excellent. So looks like I'm not able to

386
00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:52.599
Marina: hold on so looks like I'm not able to look over this info. All that talkback does

387
00:38:52.730 --> 00:39:02.349
Marina: is that it's a says web view, and then if I swipe again, then I'm just brought to my zoom overlay. So I'm not able to look over anything

388
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:12.860
Marina:  and besides, what I've noticed is with my personal experiences, with charts and whatnot. There hasn't been a

389
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:27.399
Marina: decent way to make 3. So sort of charts accessible. But anyway. yeah. So this for this one. So for the first one that I looked at, I was able to look at some stuff.

390
00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:30.909
Marina: But then, for the one I'm currently on. I'm not able to read anything.

391
00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:38.770
Marina: So, and I feel like, maybe for this one or for both charts to make it accessible. I just realized something. So

392
00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:52.689
Marina: with artificial intelligence and all that, I feel like, what what can be done is  to make it accessible. Maybe you can run for. you know, using Chat Gptp, or whatever

393
00:39:52.850 --> 00:39:56.729
Marina: model we want to do some good, maybe have that

394
00:39:57.030 --> 00:40:01.180
Marina: describe a church. you know, assuming that you're using talkback.

395
00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:05.939
Marina: and maybe that'd be the best way to make it usable.

396
00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:08.929
Marina: We'd be to run it through some sort of AI engine

397
00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:11.840
Marina: that can describe the chart for the user.

398
00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:15.190
Marina: So

399
00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.200
and summary

400
00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:31.070
Marina: I was able to. What I was able to do was add expenses or no. I was it. I first had to add budget categories. which, if there was an onboarding

401
00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:37.699
Marina: feature to begin with, so I would have been able to do that quickly before I'm trying to add expenses.

402
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:41.260
Marina: Then there was able to add

403
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:48.039
Marina: so from there I added categories, I encountered some unlabeled buttons and

404
00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:50.760
Marina: buttons that were not labeled properly.

405
00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:56.620
Marina: and then, after that are there to ask? Well, one expense.

406
00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:00.240
Marina: I wasn't able to add more due to time constraints.

407
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:02.810
Marina: Then, after that I

408
00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:11.219
Marina: then looked at trying to edit one of my budget categories. Whatever reason Talkback

409
00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:17.040
Marina: stated that I couldn't change a name, but I actually was able to.

410
00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:19.940
Marina: So that's kind of a strange one.

411
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:25.729
Marina: and then once I didn't edit that. Then I decided to look over 2 different charts.

412
00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:34.900
Marina: One chart was somewhat usable while the one I'm currently on it. Talk back, then let me view it at all.

413
00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:54.240
Marina: And my suggestion, even though first I was thinking there wasn't nothing that, you know, there wasn't anything that could be done. My suggestion overall would be, you know, to make it usable. Make both church usable, you know. Maybe haven't run, you know. Maybe somehow, integrate the use of AI,

414
00:41:54.580 --> 00:42:00.480
Marina: you have some sort of AI model so that it can describe the charts to the user.

415
00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:11.970
Marina: So money manager, open navigation drawer, that is. That is it for today. Thank you for watching and listening, and thank you for implementing accessibility into your product. Have a great day.
