Josh: Yeah, that's what I did.

41
00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:34.450

42
00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:41.409

Josh: not directly using Google Chrome.

48
00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.960
Josh:  I could try

49
00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:24.999
Josh: going to the play store and installing the dropbox app and see if

50
00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:31.509
Josh: that might make any difference. I didn't do that because I don't normally use dropbox.

51
00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:37.510
Interviewer: I see. I see? Yeah, I'll also had Google drive link. But

Interviewer: it was

53
00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:43.730

Interviewer: but it doesn't save the amount. Okay.

489
01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:22.719
Interviewer: yeah, I can see the amount. But Tom Brigg isn't focusing on it.

490
01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:23.810
Josh: Yeah.

01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:26.020

497
01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:55.140
Josh: It would appear to be the information for the current plan.

498
01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:59.130
Josh: but I'm not sure why the deadline has passed.

499
01:02:02.410 --> 01:02:03.860
Interviewer: There are no plans.

500
01:02:04.110 --> 01:02:10.110
Josh: Hmm! That's strange. Then I wonder why it's saying the deadline for this plan has passed.

Josh: Alright, we can land title, edit, box

Josh: 4, 4,

516
01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:21.520
Josh: 2, 2, 6, 6.

517
01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:25.100
Josh: Okay. Do that dollar sign

518
01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:32.310
Josh: clear text, but landed on date 2,023 by September eleventh previous month, but next month but

519
01:03:32.790 --> 01:03:50.670
Josh: 2,020.

520
01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:55.779
Josh: Your plan I successfully money manager, keyboard money manager, open application for, but

521
01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:59.279
Josh: budget plans more options, but your only contains enough money for this plan.

522
01:03:59.490 --> 01:04:01.250
Josh: Your body contains enough money for this man.

523
01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:32.910
Josh: The deadline. when the only plan present is for next month. I don't know why it's doing that. and there doesn't appear to be any clickable contents on those notations either.

524
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.570
Interviewer: and he sing it twice. Why do you think that

525
01:04:37.110 --> 01:04:38.510
Josh: I'm not sure?

526
01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:39.970
Interviewer: That's

527
01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:43.089
Josh: I'm wondering if maybe

528
01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:45.530
Josh: the deadline now

529
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:54.380
Josh: that really doesn't make sense. I wondered if maybe there were some unlabeled graphics that perhaps talkback was hanging up on. But there don't appear to be.

530
01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:03.180
Interviewer: We got it. Okay. I think we're done with the tests for

531
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:08.599
Interviewer: today. As I mentioned earlier, like, I wanted to

532
01:05:09.050 --> 01:05:11.529
here your list of

533
01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:17.510
Interviewer: reviews like accessibility and usability issues that you found that stood up to you.

534
01:05:17.730 --> 01:05:18.630
Josh: Yeah.

535
01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:24.009
Josh: well, definitely, this screen, having some erroneous information on it.

536
01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:27.010
Josh: is definitely a big

537
01:05:27.150 --> 01:05:36.399
Josh: red flag. Given that it. It's reporting that a deadline has passed when there is no deadline. That's a serious issue.

538
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.899
Josh: And the fact that the monthly expense, analysis, spring was inaccessible as

539
01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:54.260
Josh: most definitely another knock. But aside from that, though the app does seem relatively usable, there were some buttons, the adding

540
01:05:55.830 --> 01:06:01.940
Josh: adding categories and adding expenses. Those buttons did seem to be unlabelled. So I think

541
01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:14.439
Josh: talk back. Probably used optical character recognition tip. provide those labels so ideally, more clearly labeling. Those

542
01:06:15.310 --> 01:06:18.889
Josh: buttons would be advisable. But

543
01:06:20.270 --> 01:06:21.819
Josh: but overall. It was

544
01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:24.130
Josh: quite decent.

545
01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:33.050
Josh: There was that one button that was labelled Add Income, when it was only adding an expense, so that label is a bit misleading.

546
01:06:35.310 --> 01:06:40.099
Josh: but those are definitely most of those, with the exception of that deadline

547
01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:41.890
Josh: report.

548
01:06:43.330 --> 01:06:46.710
Josh: are issues that could be quite easily overcome

549
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:50.339
of her, come home

550
01:06:50.920 --> 01:07:00.910
Josh: through knowledge. through knowing what the buttons do. through also having social retail apartments ideally

551
01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:07.370
Josh: potentially

552
01:07:08.430 --> 01:07:12.530
Josh: relabeling those buttons ideally.

553
01:07:13.810 --> 01:07:17.499
Interviewer: But after having used the app and knowing what those buttons do.

554
01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:26.440
Josh: I would just know that adding income, and in that particular scenario did not mean adding more money to my walls, it just meant

555
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:29.729
Josh: submitting whatever project I was working on.

556
01:07:31.590 --> 01:07:33.480
Interviewer: It was like category, I think.

557
01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:34.690
Josh: Yes.

558
01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:38.060
Interviewer: Got

559
01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:42.470
Interviewer: okay, I think we're good for now.

560
01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:48.140
Interviewer: There was the settings thing that I had you change

561
01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:54.570
Interviewer: so you can go ahead and change it back with the allow

562
01:07:55.190 --> 01:08:02.170
Interviewer: unknown apps. But you can do it on on your own time. You have to do it now. But yeah, thank you so much for your insights.

563
01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:08.700
Interviewer: And as a disposer disclaimer, I wanted to say, like the money manager app is not.

564
01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:11.450
Interviewer: does not have as many expert issues.

565
01:08:11.740 --> 01:08:22.680
Interviewer: Some of them were added for our research purposes to know that the app itself isn't as as bad. But

566
01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:31.109
Interviewer: yeah, but yeah, we'll analyze this data and thank you so much. Thank you. Have a wonderful day you, too! Bye, bye.
