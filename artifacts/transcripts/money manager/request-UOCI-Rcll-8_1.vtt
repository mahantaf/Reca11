00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:18.140
Jennifer: so I found this app really difficult to use. Part of it was that it just didn't make intuitive sense to me. I mean, it looked like there were edit boxes, but I couldn't get them to work.

308
00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:24.349
Jennifer: And Then, you know, II got stuck in the calendar, and

309
00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:30.620
Jennifer: couldn't get out of it, and that that was really hard, but

310
00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:48.389
Jennifer:  because I think it would be easier if you could somehow collapse and expand the calendar. So maybe you know, if you want to expand it, you could double tap on a button where it would expand, cause that was probably the most difficult part for me was getting stuck in the calendar.

311
00:35:49.050 --> 00:36:01.420
Jennifer: Once, I figured out, you know, like month's expenses, and you know then the budget  And all the categories under the application drawer

312
00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:15.140
Jennifer: like the month's expenses and the budget category. And then, when you pressed each one it would give the title, and then I was able to kind of figure out what I needed to do in order to create the categories. And then also that

313
00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:38.939
Jennifer: arrow worked to that down arrow that expanded the menus that worked as well, and I was able to choose my categories. But at first I was really really confused because I wasn't sure what to do. And then the calendar that that was really confusing for me, too, because I couldn't find where to add the expenses. I think it would be good if the add expenses was not only like maybe on the bottom, but also kind of on the top

314
00:36:39.110 --> 00:37:08.590
Jennifer: so that you know you could get to it easily from wherever you were. Because otherwise, you know, it's really easy to get into the calendar, and then, if the calendar could be collapse somehow, that would be really helpful, too. But I was able to add the categories. Now, I don't really understand the analysis very well. I don't know if I'm missing something, or if I did something wrong, but I don't really understand it. All that. Well, I mean it said. I'm supposed to analyze 2 things, but I don't really know that I have

315
00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:21.970
Jennifer: but I did create a budget and I was able to also do the plan. And once I kind of figured out, you know the whole thing with the calendar. It was okay, but I think it would really be good if that calendar could be collapsed.

316
00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:26.469
So this concludes the task for today, and thank you so much for choosing fable.
