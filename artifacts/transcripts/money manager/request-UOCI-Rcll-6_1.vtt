194
00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:50.569
Jennifer: It was. It was okay. I mean, it took me a little get to get used to because I was like, Okay, cause I couldn't get the dropdown list, because I think the dropdown list probably would have told me a bunch of categories right? And then I could have just chosen one.

195
00:41:52.020 --> 00:42:12.539
Jennifer: But it wouldn't II couldn't get it to open, so that was a little confusing cause. I wasn't quite sure where to put it, and then, when I thought I was done, I thought it had already saved it, but I needed to add it first. So you know it.

198
00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:36.860

199
00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:50.920
Jennifer: No, not to me. I thought maybe there were some in there. That's why there was a dropdown. Okay, I get it. I get it. I'm not the only one.

Yeah, because, remember, I went in there before, and that's how I know, and otherwise I never would have known that. I never would have known that. But the reason I knew. That is because I tried it out once before, and I remember it had that whole category thing. What does it stand for? By the way

264
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:26.869
Jennifer: add transaction. But transaction budget category equals. One product. Name equals Starbucks. I know it took a long time, but you know it's just I'm

265
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:51.009
Jennifer: It did this. This. This takes a little bit of it does have a little bit of a learning curve for me. And maybe it's because, you know I don't. I mean, I will confess I don't use a lot of budgeting apps, so that may be part of the reason why, but there are some things that were just kinda like, oh, I didn't know that I thought I could select one from the Dropdown list. I didn't know I had to add my own categories. I mean it makes sense, in a way.

266
00:52:51.010 --> 00:53:08.400
Jennifer: But you know, I mean, like some apps, you know, when they have the drop down lists. It means that you have like choices, and some of em don't really, you know. Choose one by default. You have to press on the drop down list, and then it opens up, and then you choose one. But if you don't choose one, it just says, Drop down list.

267
00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:14.729
Interviewer: So what do you think would be a good way to inform you of what you need to do?

268
00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:16.370
Jennifer: Oh.

269
00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:27.120
Jennifer: maybe, since you don't have any categories. Maybe once you have a category, then maybe the drop down list could show up.

270
00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:37.500
Jennifer: if that's possible. Otherwise maybe it could have like a little, you know a little thing that says no items.

271
00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:44.920
Jennifer: and then that would be a good you know. A good Q.

272
00:53:45.010 --> 00:54:02.920
Jennifer: To say, Hey, you need to add something to your dropdown list, because you don't have any items in it, you know, because otherwise it's like, why isn't an opening? Is this an accessibility error. What's going on here? So yeah, that's that's just it. You know, you don't automatically know it.

273
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:27.039
Interviewer: What about when you like? What about the other elements of that page other than the drop down list. Well, I mean the wallet thing. Yeah, that makes sense. I didn't have any money in my wallet, so it's kind of hard to spend money. You don't have I like that air that air popped up right away, and I was able to say, Oh, yeah, yeah. I need to put some stuff in my wallet

274
00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:36.149
Jennifer: far, as the add transaction. At first, when it said it would when it said done. When I first tried to add it, I thought it was already added that, but

275
00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:39.369
Jennifer: so that that was a little bit

276
00:54:40.370 --> 00:54:46.149
Jennifer: confusing for me. because I thought once it said done. You know you had already

277
00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:56.429
Jennifer: done it. But you know certainly, if I would have scanned around the screen, I would have been like, Wait a minute. Where is it? It probably hasn't added yet.

278
00:54:56.450 --> 00:55:00.690
Jennifer: So then you can kind of tell but

279
00:55:01.450 --> 00:55:05.120
Jennifer: you know, it's just it's just a bit confusing, because

280
00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:23.860
Interviewer: you know, instead of having like a save button or something like that they, you know, just add transactions. So I thought, oh, I can add another transaction. But no, I was still working on my original, one.

281
00:55:23.950 --> 00:55:43.229
Jennifer: yeah, exactly. Yeah, no, no, I didn't understand. I mean, I would have figured it out, I mean some of this just comes with getting used to using an app. You know what I mean cause when you first open it up you might think that something is one way, and it really isn't so. I mean, this does have a little bit of a learning curve, at least for me. So.

282
00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:54.900
Jennifer: But as far as like finding the dates, I mean, that was really easy. It was really easy to change the dates which I really like. And you know, it was really easy to tell to which date you were on.

283
00:55:56.570 --> 00:55:58.430
Interviewer: Okay, that's good.

284
00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:11.370

00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:14.990

Jennifer: you know what I don't know where to go to.

318
01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:21.599
Jennifer: because it says it can't edit it, said I can't edit it so I guess I could go in the navigation drawer and look around. But I think I'm already

319
01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:36.880
Interviewer: it it is. It is where you were. But the thing is like the cursor for editing. The text was at the bit front. So when you were, you know, back spacing it, we're trying to delete. It wasn't deleting anything, because it was the very beginning of the word.

320
01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:40.159
Jennifer: Yeah, but it said I couldn't change a category name.

321

325
01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:34.500
Interviewer: beginning of that word. Yeah, yeah, okay, I understand. The problem I was having. Is it said that I couldn't change the category name. So I'm like.

326
01:01:35.070 --> 01:01:43.599
Jennifer: why can't I change the category name? Yeah. I mean, I wonder why it says that that's weird.

327
01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:51.200
Interviewer: but we don't have to change it.

328
01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:56.479

329
01:01:57.530 --> 01:02:02.180
Jennifer: Thank you. I went. Why does it say, though, that I can't change the category name

330
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:09.320
Jennifer: I honestly don't know. I think it's just warning you not to, but you can actually change it.

331
01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:20.339
Jennifer: cause that's where I was confused. And that's why I'm like. Oh, yeah. Well, let me delete it because I can't change the category name. I didn't even think that. Oh, it's at the beginning.

332
01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:35.090
Jennifer: But yeah, that I'd have to go down and and get to the end of the text. Yeah, alright. Now, let's see. So if I do this. Okay? So I'm in the wrong place.

333
01:02:35.530 --> 01:02:38.880
Jennifer: Category, name window Moroc, budget, category

Jennifer: Add transaction, button transaction, budget category equals to product name equals Amazon. Price equals 115.0 by 89, Friday, September fifteenth, (484) 016-2023. I almost think that

347
01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:51.320
Jennifer: It would be better if it could be an expandable and collapsible thing, so you wouldn't have to keep scanning. I mean, I know you can scroll, and you can try to do explore by touch, which sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. But II almost think it would be easier if you could just expand and collapse it. But that being said, it isn't that bad the way it is. I do like the fact that it's really easy to switch dates. I mean, I do really really like that.

348
01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:53.939

Interviewer: budget plan I'm making.

415
01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:20.429

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:45.459
Jennifer: money manager, manager, budget, month, money manager, manager. But budget categories, analysis, monthly expenses, budget plans. Oh, budget plans duh. Okay, here we go. The deadline of this plan has passed.

417
01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:53.679
Jennifer: Button, annotation, button window, running manager, plan, title, edit, box

418
01:12:53.930 --> 01:13:05.029
Jennifer: characters, enters lambda, script characters and plans. Budget planned deadline date. What? What is Friday, September fifteenth, previous month? But

419
01:13:05.050 --> 01:13:09.960
Jennifer: next month? Okay. So if I do next month, double tap on next month.

420
01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:13.900
Jennifer: page 1486 of 2412 will. This will do well.

421
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:23.930
Jennifer: Friday, September fifteenth, previous month, button next month, but October first, 2023, and later October first.

422
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:27.400
Jennifer: October second, 2023.

423
01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:36.259
Jennifer: Let's see. October 20, eighth, 23, October on October 20, eighth October.

424
01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:41.989
Jennifer: Add plan button out of page one. So I then I add plans. I double tap on here.

425
01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:43.540
Jennifer: add plan.

426
01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:47.710
Oh.

427
01:13:56.850 --> 01:14:00.220
Jennifer: your wallet contains another month. Your wallet contains the deadline of this lambda.

428
01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:03.339
Jennifer: so that, like on this map clap, button.

429
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:09.510
Jennifer: It went away. I think I'm back where it started. Aren't I

430
01:14:10.150 --> 01:14:14.379
Jennifer: add anything because you didn't add any?

431
01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:31.599
Interviewer: I was trying to, but it kind of froze up on me. Let's see here, let me what do you think these information is about the wallet containing enough money of the deadline being passed.

432
01:14:32.330 --> 01:14:39.110
Jennifer: Yeah, that's kind of weird, because II guess I didn't. I didn't make the dates long enough for something

433
01:14:40.470 --> 01:14:48.789
Jennifer: right? I don't know. Yeah, I guess maybe I didn't make the deadlines long enough, like, I only made it till the fifteenth.

434
01:14:49.950 --> 01:14:59.080
Interviewer: Hmm, yeah, that plan wasn't saved. So these are something else. But these are like labels for

435
01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:04.020
Interviewer: the the plans in the list. But they're color-coded.

436
01:15:04.150 --> 01:15:07.020
Interviewer: so it doesn't really help you in this case.

437
01:15:07.090 --> 01:15:16.829
Jennifer: Oh, okay, okay, yeah. I didn't really understand what that meant, but I was a little bit confused. Did you want me to add the plan or

438
01:15:16.830 --> 01:15:41.489
Jennifer: no. II know we're running out of running. Oh, oh, I didn't know that. Okay, sorry about that. It just kind of froze up on me, and I'm like, so I may have accidentally pressed the for something accidentally, but you know, once it but it doesn't talk, I mean, and it wasn't responding to my touches, either. And I got kind of like, oh, no, I just did. I just freeze up my phone. But that's okay.

439
01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:49.000
Jennifer: Sorry. Yeah, Thomas, can you? Can you give me like a summary or like a list of the accessibility issues or the review of the app?

440
01:15:50.700 --> 01:16:01.010
Jennifer: Okay, let's see so as far as the the accessibility issues.

441
01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:16.760
Jennifer: let's see, there was the one with the Fab button. I didn't really know what that was I figured it out, but I wasn't really sure what it would, so that was a verse one. It probably should have a label on it. And then there was the

442
01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:18.910
Jennifer: the

443
01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:35.129
Jennifer: the web, the the pie charts, and not being able to open the website.  and let me think. Oh, and there were those those buttons you were telling me about those color coded buttons and that sort of thing, those those weren't labeled

444
01:16:35.290 --> 01:16:38.960
Jennifer:  I think

445
01:16:39.650 --> 01:16:40.689
Jennifer: that was it.

446
01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:55.600
Jennifer: Maybe I think I'm trying to remember. No, I think. Well, the settings, the settings didn't work, either. Yeah. The settings didn't work either. Yup.

447
01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:58.019
Jennifer: and those were the ones that I can remember.

448
01:16:59.170 --> 01:17:18.979
Jennifer: Alright cool before we exit we let's close out the notescribe
