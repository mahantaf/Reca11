117
00:23:44.310 --> 00:24:06.949
Interviewer: And before we open money manager we have to open, or we have to set up note Scribe, and that app is strictly for our research purposes. What it does. It is a background service that tracks like your interaction with money manager app and with. We would later with for a research, try to analyze like the user interaction.

118
00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:07.890

119
00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:20.469

208
00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:12.430
Ben: the apps fall. But I could be wrong. You know what I mean.

523
01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:19.390

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:24.530
Interviewer: okay.

526
01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:38.449
Interviewer:  And the labeling. I know. You say that there was some unlabeled buttons, but otherwise they weren't that obtrusive?

527
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:40.249
Ben: Yeah, no. Yeah.

528
01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:46.080
Ben: yeah, I mean, like, i'd say, label, the, add button, you know, just so

529
01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:55.709
Ben: if you don't have the talkback recognition on it'll still be. No, it'll be read as an Add Button, because some people might wonder what that enabled Button is.

530
01:03:59.030 --> 01:04:04.739
Interviewer: and when you edit a transaction you realize which

531
01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:08.930
Interviewer: text wanted to to add the expense.

532
01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:13.500
Interviewer: Do you remember like how how you came to realize that?

533
01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:15.650
Ben: Yeah. So

534
01:04:16.570 --> 01:04:19.540
Ben: Yes, I realize that the first field

535
01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:24.810
Ben: was for the title, and the second one was for the dollar, because II

536
01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:30.559
Ben: tapped on the second field and it popped up a keyboard for the dollar for the dollar amount. So it was like, Okay.

537
01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:36.590
Ben: alright. So then, I obviously, you know, assume that the first first one

538
01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:39.360
Ben: first field is for the title

539
01:04:39.790 --> 01:04:41.359
Ben: per the expense title

540
01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:44.700
Interviewer: done.

541
01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:49.350

Interviewer: you know, cause their label would be helpful.

543
01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.959

544
01:04:58.090 --> 01:05:01.560

549
01:05:22.610 --> 01:05:24.090

550
01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:29.289

551
01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:31.179
Ben: and it tells me selected.

552
01:05:31.310 --> 01:05:34.600
