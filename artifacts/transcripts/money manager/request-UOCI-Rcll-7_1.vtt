00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:50.319
Jack: keyboard, 80 edit box enter, invite both edit boxes, say, enter info. However, one of them sounds like the line item, name.

177
00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:54.379
Interviewer: and this one sounds like a dollar amount. Cause talk bets, said Dollar sign.

178
00:32:56.610 --> 00:33:01.069
Jack: So if the labels could be changed to something more descriptive

179
00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:03.440
got it.

180
00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:07.539
Jack: For example, the first one says, enter line item, and the second one says, Enter amount

181
00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:09.220
Umhm.

182
00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:14.539
Interviewer: sign, clear text. But

183
00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:30.120
Interviewer: how big is it? Internet detected? Icon product category detected? 10. No, II can see like this hint underneath that say, product, name, product price. But topic isn't

184
00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:42.400
Jack: as a label.

185
00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:48.430
Interviewer: And what do you think about the dropdown list? What happened. Actually.

186
00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:53.949
Jack: it is working now. I would think it would be. It would behoove users to have a

187
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:59.180
Jack: maybe when they first install the app, it said, Okay, welcome. Let's get you set up with some categories

188
00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:00.400
Interviewer: because

189
00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:05.500
Jack: I mean, it makes sense. You need. You can't have a budget line item without a category. However.

190
00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:18.769
Jack: the app doesn't tell you that when you install it so it makes you think that the drop down list is broken when in reality it's just waiting for you to add some categories before you can add some line items.

191
00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:24.569
Interviewer: Absolutely. There should be some context clues to.

192
00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:27.019
Jack: Yes. So you look at an intro screen like

193
00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:33.159
Jack: before we get started. Tell me what your categories are. Your spending categories?

194
00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:38.489
Interviewer: Great? Okay? You can add this transaction.

195
00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:50.009
Jack: $80 sign, clear tech transaction date, previous month, next month, September first, 2,023 Friday, September for product category. A new trend

196
00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:58.020
Jack: detected. Icon Internet character, $80, cleartext transaction date 2,020. Sept. September the sixteenth, 2,023

197
00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:11.879
Jack: steps a transaction button out of pager September transaction. Okay, add transaction. Button should absolutely be in the top right hand corner of the screen.

198
00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:19.810
Jack: where most done buttons are inside applications, and where the more options button is in this application's home screen.

199
00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:25.230
Interviewer: but because, having to roll all the way to the bottom

200
00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:37.500
Jack: to find the add transaction, button was made it a little cumbersome. It is empty. You cannot buy anything for now. Money manager at the expense, button, button.

201
00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:46.070
Jack: total expense, utility.

202
00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:49.270
Jack: It says something is empty. You cannot buy anything right now

203
00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:56.230
Jack: it sent your wallet to something. Oh, the wallet. Okay, that category. Name more options, once expense spoken, navigation drawer

204
00:35:56.940 --> 00:36:06.979
Jack: and money check budget, budget analysis, monthly expense, budget plan. month. But budget checked month's expenses, money manager, check budget categories. budget analysis.

205
00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:09.809
Jack: monthly expenses, analysis, budget plans

Jack: head and come to your wallet, head and come button money. Amount, edit, box.

210
00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:36.160
Jack: screen, tape, screen away mode tabletop mode, number 8, 0 0 keyboard, clear text, but

211
00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:53.950
Jack: 8. I didn't come. Button. Your wallet contains now 800.0 money manager, 4 options button category, your expense, Internet info, $0, 0 slot. There's a lot of things that the app lets you do or acts like it's going to let you do.

212
00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:57.449
Jack: and then lets you know you can't do them when it's too late.

213
00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:02.740
Interviewer: Have to have to reset and start all over again.

214
00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:04.700
Jack: Exactly. Exactly.

215
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:11.009
Jack: So. I think there should be like all this stuff that's about like.

216
00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:13.670
So the app, the. So one, the app basically

217
00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:19.150
Jack: told you without telling you that you need category. You need categories before you can put line items.

218
00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:33.700
Jack: Then it told you you need money before you can budget it, which is obvious which makes sense, but it should be something that they have. Well. have you set up first before you start adding line items kind. It's like

219
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.119
Jack: the order of events here doesn't really follow what

220
00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:41.480
Jack: orderly path, as it were.

221
00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:48.369
Interviewer: You got it? Sure you're right. So there should be some

222
00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:57.580
Interviewer: like screens that this to configure all these stuff, and then list to add a new transaction. Yes, like when when you first.

223
00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:02.389
Interviewer: when you first launch the app, say, Okay.

224
00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:08.139
Jack: Hi, welcome to, you know late manager. Before we get started. Tell me how much money you make per month.

225
00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:13.410
Jack: $1,000. Let's say, okay, great. So what are your

226
00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:16.710
Jack: what are your

227
00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:22.690
Jack: What are your expense categories or spending categories? And then you do that.

228
00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:26.109
Jack: So then, by the time you have the app started.

229
00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:30.470
Jack: or maybe he could, and he could even do something like they could even do

230
00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:42.020
Jack: some example, categories with like check boxes like, Do use. Do you do? Do you have categories of following rent, checkbox, auto loan, checkbox or

231
00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:51.650
Jack: auto insurance check box like just a bunch of preset kind of run of the mill categories that you could just quickly add without having to type them out.

232
00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:57.099
Jack: And then the ones you actually have of your own. Then you can type those out type only the ones you need

233
00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.840
Jack: to type out in that regard.

234
00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.660
Interviewer: And yep.

235
00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:06.709
Jack: that would make the on that would make the on morning

236
00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:10.310
Jack: easy, and I mean it'll make the app more. Let's face it more personal.

237
00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:12.100
Interviewer: It's true.

238
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:18.920
Jack: which is kind of similar to like when you open a a new social media account, or like a forum

239
00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:26.430
Interviewer: paying the credit and it when you start, it says, like what summers or what topics you're interested in.

240
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:31.790
Interviewer: So with a group of subscriptions, or if you

241
00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:36.629
Jack: watch a TV streaming service that could say, like, what are you? You know. What kind of

242
00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:40.220
Jack: show genres are you interested, or what channels are you interested.

243
00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:41.300
Interviewer: Umhm?

244
00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:44.560
Jack: This could be a same thing. There could be a

245
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.330
Jack: an efficient user onboarding

246
00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:53.800

247
00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:54.790
Interviewer: Yeah.

248
00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.099

Jack: Thank you. That was, there was no dead ends

250
00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:10.790
Jack: like there were when we tried to add something that didn't work. and then we try to do the drop down list, and it was empty, you know and stuff like that.

251
00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:16.629

00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:58.640
Jack:  However, it is worth bearing in mind.

294
00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:10.890
Jack: This is a pixel 6 pro. And probably has a good machine learning kip in it, too, when compared to say. a budget. Phone from like Walmart, or something like that

295
00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:20.589
Jack: which would explain why it's doing a better job. You know, the the results are probably going to be varied greatly on image recognition, I would imagine.

296
00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:25.749
Interviewer: Yep, I'm pretty sure there is some on-device machine learning going on somewhere

297
00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:29.519
Jack: to make that happen.

298
00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:36.059
Jack: So whenever there is like something like that.

299
00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:45.219
Jack: what you hear from talk back on this phone might be completely different from another phone. So adding pure labels to the buttons, is still the way to go.

300
00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:49.840
Interviewer: Yep.

301
00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:51.850
Jack: stay

302
00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:54.699
Jack: speaking of labels, now that we mentioned that

303
00:45:55.930 --> 00:45:58.149
Jack: none of these budget plans are labeled

304
00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:02.640
which is unlabeled.

305
00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:09.270
Jack: the depth your wallet contains enough money for this plan. Your wallet contains enough money for this plan. Well, what plan?

306
00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:13.919
Interviewer: All? It contains enough money for this plan also. What plan?

307
00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:19.010
Interviewer: What do you think these? These text is referring to?

308
00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:29.710
Jack: Referring to certain plan? It it seems like there are 4 plans, cause there are 4 items, 1, 2 of them say your wallet contains enough money for this plan. 2 of them say

309
00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:33.910
Jack: the deadline for this plan has expired.

310
00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:37.470
Interviewer: but no other information.

311
00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:40.389
no other information other than the add button

312
00:46:41.050 --> 00:46:46.590
Jack: detected like

313
00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:50.570
Jack: plan info, plan, title, edit, box. characters, plan, type

314
00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:53.340
Jack: screener way, mode showing frail tech

315
00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:58.340
Jack: cable characters. Entered 9 of 50 plan description, edit, box.

316
00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:01.080
Jack: screen away mode

317
00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:05.480
Jack: a, a test, that

318
00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:09.180
Jack: is it. You have H. Deleted, a

319
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:12.810
Jack: de-delated budget, deleted, deleted.

320
00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:15.780
Jack: and

321
00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:18.859
Jack: done. 6 space delete

322
00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:26.170
Jack: keep clear text, but character limit exceeded plans. Budget edit. Character limit exceeded 57 and 50. Clear. This is a test that assumes

323
00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:29.050
Jack: show budget, deleted and limited, deleted

324
00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:42.260
Jack: and limited. Next B. Space deleted. unlimited maximum length reached unlimited space deleted. I did that mode. Place your device with the chart on account of, I figured that was going to happen.

325
00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:48.659
Jack: We certainly do not have characters now.

326
00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:51.520
Interviewer: The edit box does act like you do, though.

327
00:47:51.870 --> 00:48:04.109
Jack: So maybe if there's something that could like throw you out of the edit box somehow, and said, Please, delete some characters like an alert or just something that stops accepting character input or plays a set.

328
00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:07.220
Jack: Maybe the app could play a sound

329
00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:08.830
Jack: For example.

330
00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:19.699
Jack: when accessible, twitter clients for the blind or IM clients that had character limits or had to adhere to the character limits of said service.

331
00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:23.370
Jack: Had audio alerts.

332
00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:29.909
Jack: for when you enter like you could enter a character, and it would be accepted, but it would annoy you with a

333
00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:34.219
Jack: a beep for any character that exceeded the limit.

334
00:48:36.850 --> 00:48:48.389
Jack: If there's no way to actually reject character input, then that would be the best way to work around, that is, by putting in a clearly noticeable sound that's not

335
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:52.940
Jack: similar to a keyword click or anything like that.

336
00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:58.680
Interviewer: Got it. And I think something something like

337
00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:06.829
Interviewer: interpret it into the core edit from Google in the core text. You said

338
00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:15.649
Interviewer: it is not, but it should be as you mentioned it should. Yeah, it should be built in, because that way you don't have to add, because right like it seems like what you'd have to do is add some sort of

339
00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:26.699
Jack: equivalent to like, I know, in Javascript you could do an event. Listener. But, you know, does that do some equivalent to that that gets like listens monitors? How many characters are in the field like, if

340
00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:31.610
Jack: if character count greater than 50, play sound kind of thing.

341
00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:36.710
Jack: cause I know there's a label. Well, yeah, actually, yeah, you might be able to add that to the

342
00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:46.520
Jack: cause. I know if you add some code to the the label that says what character is remaining, they're clearly apps, clearly counting, because that's also not a I don't think the

343
00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:50.560
Jack: character limit is also not a built in thing in text fields.

344
00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:56.460
Jack: Hence. Why, you have to have external for for edit box.

345
00:49:56.760 --> 00:50:10.350
Interviewer:  you can add like a Max count.

346
00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:25.199
Jack: but maybe like, because there's something else in the app that's not like the maximum like the character. The current character account is display in its own element. Maybe that could have a something to do with a potential sound

347
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:28.199
Interviewer: effects that would go off like a buzzer

348
00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:31.010
Jack: if the character length is is exceeded.

349
00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:32.450
Interviewer: Yep.

350
00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:35.020
Jack: okay. So

351
00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:38.990
Jack: space end of delete have deleted you. Deleted assumes deleted that deleted

352
00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:45.550
Jack: clear text, but characters entered 15 clients. Budget, edit box plans. Budget.

353
00:50:45.730 --> 00:50:48.840
Jack: It's a confusing label. What's supposed to mean? Deadline date

354
00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:52.360
Jack: plans, budget Ed, but budget amount?

355
00:50:54.010 --> 00:50:55.639
Interviewer: What do you think a plan is?

356
00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:59.460
Jack: So this planet like

357
00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:02.949
Jack: how to allocate

358
00:51:03.130 --> 00:51:05.120
Jack: and or spend, or save

359
00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:07.809
Jack: by? So you know, within a certain timeline.

360
00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:11.009
Jack: So yes. So

361
00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:15.409
Jack: with the plan's budget, I assume that means dollar amount.

362
00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:23.140
Jack: deadline date clients, budget.

363
00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:25.549
Jack: dollar, sign, screener way, mode number

364
00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:27.070
Jack: 2, 0

365
00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:32.419
Jack: keyboard dollar sign clear text, but plan, deadline, date 2,023,

366
00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:47.219
Jack: Friday previous month, but next September first, 2,023. In September, September, September September eighteenth, 2,000. September, Septem, Sept. September 20, ninth. Sept. Saturday.

367
00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:52.899
Interviewer: A plan button money manager detected that button.

368
00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:54.100
Jack: I'm sorry. Was that

369
00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:56.560
Interviewer: what's your opinion on the calendar?

370
00:51:56.830 --> 00:51:58.480
Jack: Very workable, perfect.

371
00:51:59.470 --> 00:52:00.330
Interviewer: Got it?

372
00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:12.769
Jack: Test plan. This is the deadline of this plan. Test plan. This is a test. Saturday, September thirtieth, 2,023200. Enlist your wall. Your wallet contains enough money for this plan.

373
00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:25.790
Jack: Enough money. Your wallet contains enough money test plans here, but there's not like they're obviously some more than the plans I enter, but they're not saying anything.

374
00:52:27.570 --> 00:52:28.500
Interviewer: So.

375
00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:38.089
Interviewer: The explanation is is that those 2 options like your wallet, contains enough money. Event has passed are like labels.

376
00:52:38.350 --> 00:52:40.089
Interviewer: and they're color-coded.

377
00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:51.340
Interviewer: So, for example, while it contains enough, money is green labeled, and your current test plan is like showing green, because you know, it's like you, Wallet.

378
00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:54.310
Jack: I see. Okay. I wonder if

379
00:52:55.580 --> 00:53:02.790
Jack: I wonder if you could do that some other way to avoid confusion, like maybe maybe grey out. The plans that say

380
00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:08.160
Jack: that are just like the plans that you don't have enough money for can just be disabled controls

381
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:10.090
Interviewer: instead.

382
00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:21.829
Jack: cause you also like it. Color contrast, you know, contrasting specifically, the color alone is also already is already not a good idea. So

383
00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:26.309
Jack:  so yeah, you might want to.

384
00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:29.370
Jack:  have an alternate.

385
00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:31.759
Jack: an additional method for that

386
00:53:32.010 --> 00:53:36.860
Jack: like, especially if we're talking, aligning with a Wcag or something like that.

387
00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:43.800
Interviewer:  the color coding is is completely inaccessible.

388
00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:52.009
Jack: It's an accessible, for I have no usable vacant, so it would be accessible for me, and it would also be an accessible hmm

389
00:53:52.330 --> 00:53:54.259
Jack: to someone with a colorblindness.

390
00:53:55.070 --> 00:53:56.350
Jack: Yep.

391
00:53:56.820 --> 00:54:04.119
Jack: yeah. So having that be. the only way in which it is identified is a

392
00:54:05.350 --> 00:54:10.439
Jack:  doesn't doesn't pass for accessible. So

393
00:54:11.010 --> 00:54:14.469
Jack: having the controls be disabled, be grayed out.

394
00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:21.790
Jack: would be a much more obvious way of telling people which budgets are. Plans are available and which ones aren't

395
00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:23.610
Interviewer: got it.

396
00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:25.490
Interviewer: Okay.

397
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:29.759
Jack: that's what I figured it was after I started adding budgets to

398
00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:36.419
Jack: when I started adding, budget plan like, Wait, that's not right. Cause it doesn't like it's act like I have one budget plan.

399
00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:46.870
Jack: even though it acts like, or it appears it. It makes it appear as though there are more. There are 4 more. even though there aren't. And the 2

400
00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:51.210
Jack: said, your wallet has enough money, and then 2 of em say, your wallet is not

401
00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:54.780
Interviewer: one of my

402
00:54:54.900 --> 00:55:01.820
Interviewer: each of them were announcing it twice, because one of them was announcing it for the color itself, like there is a

403
00:55:01.850 --> 00:55:08.009
Interviewer: image of the color. and then the text and topic is announcing both.

404
00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:13.400
Interviewer: There are 4 plans. But it's actually just 2 labels

405
00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:15.610
Interviewer: indicating the legend of the

406
00:55:16.350 --> 00:55:18.189
Interviewer: just. Okay, I would say

407
00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:23.069
I would definitely for that, for many of those reasons, I would definitely reframe from

408
00:55:23.650 --> 00:55:26.280
Jack: having color be the only way those are identified.

409
00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:29.639
Interviewer: Note it.

410
00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:36.919
Interviewer: Let's go to the 2. Analysis. Okay, the application drawer

411
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:49.889
Jack: menu, months, budget analysis. open navigation drawer. But budget analysis, more options. But web view pie chart entitled, your expenses per category this month with 2 points min. Value is 60. Max. Value is 90 article

412
00:55:50.490 --> 00:55:57.410
Jack: good, good. Any chart trial version comma link, any chi, any chart trial version comma link, any chart. Javascript chart utilities.

413
00:55:57.630 --> 00:56:04.500
Jack: any chart, tile version comma link, any chart. Javascript charts designed to be embedded and integrated. D 8, 4, 2, 1, 9, 2, 4

414
00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:10.820
Jack: the trials. The trial screen is that is that just because the apps are prototype or

415
00:56:12.010 --> 00:56:13.499
Interviewer: the 8?

416
00:56:13.530 --> 00:56:27.239
Interviewer: the Api used for generating the pie chart is using like a trial version. That's what. Yeah. So I thought, like, is it? That's not something that would appear in a like a product in a production build. Right?

417
00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:30.359
Jack: Yeah, melodies. Internet and phone

418
00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:32.880
Jack: utilities. Well, 0 0

419
00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:36.530
Jack: bring more information. Visit our website.

420
00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:45.390
Jack: Any chart pie chart, entitled Your Expenses per Category this month, with 2 points in value is 60 Max. Value is 90 article.

421
00:56:45.940 --> 00:56:51.019
Jack: It does look like any charts pie chart. It allows for alt text or

422
00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:54.809
Jack: has it because it's very descriptive.

423
00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:03.950
Interviewer: Got it? Can it go kind of go to the website? It's referring to

424
00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:08.249
you enter you 2 0 0. If we want visit our website.

425
00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:10.649
Jack: that one, no next heading

426
00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:14.870
Jack: talk back menu links, enlist links, website, inlist

427
00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:24.369
Jack: 0% progress bar 0%. Chrome Github, not an awesome money manager, app Java android app that can help you manage your budget, track your expenses, pull requests common link.

428
00:57:25.370 --> 00:57:30.920
Interviewer: I was saying it was successful in going into the website. Oh, great! Oh, to the Github. Yep.

429
00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:33.889
Jack: money manager visit our website.

430
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:38.040
Interviewer: Okay, it's perfect. Let's go to the other analysis page.

431
00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:42.139
Jack: Oh, my chart entitled Your Expenses per capita option budget analysis built in navigation.

432
00:57:42.290 --> 00:57:55.929
Jack: money, month, expense, budget categories, checked budget, monthly expenses, analysis, monthly expenses, analysis, open navigation, monthly export options, button web view. no next default or web view, no next default accessible.

433
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:58.160
Jack: Just a blank web view.

434
00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:01.530
Interviewer: It is the only. So it appears

435
00:58:02.290 --> 00:58:03.140
Jack: that was it.

436
00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:05.990
Interviewer: And that's the only content in the screen

437
00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:07.880
Jack: web view.

438
00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:11.510
Yeah. correct. Other than the navigation buttons.

439
00:58:13.330 --> 00:58:18.549
Interviewer: I see there is a a button at the very end, but I I'm guessing it cannot access

440
00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:24.150
Jack: it. Whatever it is, it does not appear to be a label button or a visible button.

441
00:58:24.290 --> 00:58:25.230
Interviewer: Got it.
