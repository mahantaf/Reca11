00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:40.640
Interviewer: And you want to buy like a TV next month. So you need a budget plan for it. So think about these things and try to navigate this app and use these functionalities by your own.

79
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:51.860
Interviewer: I will be here, but I won't intervene or intrude upon your navigation. You will try to accomplish all of this and just freestyle, the application.

80
00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:53.480
Interviewer: Justice Harris.

81
00:07:53.950 --> 00:08:04.880
Marina: and then, just let you know some. You I use a talk back to navigate the app. So if I have to stop to let you know of any issues that come across, I will do that.

82
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:10.680
Interviewer: Not only say it when you come across issues. But also just think aloud

83
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.060
Interviewer: when you're clicking something or what you're

84
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:17.539
Interviewer: observer being or what you're listening to, and what that makes you think

85
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.230
Marina: okay, perfect

86
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.970

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:24.840
Marina: month's expenses.

88
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.630
Marina: more options, but category. Name

91
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:50.800
Marina: category name.

92
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.800
Marina: So I will focus on this

93
00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.589
Marina: part where I get to add my expenses total, add expense button

94
00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:09.830
Marina: and new transaction product category drop down, list detected. I calm down.

95
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:18.320
Marina: Okay. Enter info edit box detected icon product detected icon down dropdown list.

96
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:28.650
Marina: So I'm assuming it's a talkback thing. cause. There is some kind of image recognition that kicked in. So

97
00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:41.790
Marina: what it said was detected. Arrow down so sounds like whatever talkback was doing.

98
00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:48.939
Marina: I get, you know, like some kind of image recognition thing kicked in. But I already knew it was a drop down, to begin with, so I will activate that

99
00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.189
Marina: enter detected.

100
00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:56.560
Marina: Who? So

101
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:03.009
Marina: I keep double tapping that dropdown thing. But nothing's happening.

102
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.810
Interviewer: Why do you think so? That what do you think that's happened?

103
00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:11.720
Marina: Detected icon down drop-down list

104
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:21.780
Marina: so like where it's a dropdown. Usually. What I would expect to happen is so talkback, you know, plays a different specific sound to tell you when that buttons been activated.

105
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:32.679
Marina: So yeah, when you use talkback, you have to navigate kind of differently as opposed to how

106
00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:35.779
Marina: anyone else uses the screen

107
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:42.230
Marina: to afford a reason on my end when I double tap. Nothing happened, and

108
00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:51.439
Marina: September September sixth. Free transaction. Enter info edit box, enter info edit box detected. Icon down dropdown list.

109
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:57.629
Marina: So yeah, noticing nothing's not let me drop down.

110
00:10:58.050 --> 00:10:59.880
Marina: But I think I'll be able to.

111
00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.700
Marina: Yeah on the air category on that product category

112
00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:11.310
Marina:  yeah, when I swipe to the right next one over dropdown list.

113
00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:16.229
Marina: so you know just at the drop down list. But when I double tap, obviously nothing happens.

114
00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.270
Marina: Enter info and box.

115
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.799
Marina: Then next one over it says, Enter info

116
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:29.489
Marina:  I feel like

117
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:34.020
Marina: wait a minute. I think I know what's going on. Characters entered. 0 of 10.

118
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:36.219
Marina: Enter info, edit box.

119
00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:43.929
Marina: transaction date. Enter info edit. Okay? So yeah, I kind of see some confusion here.

120
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.480
Interviewer: What, what are you confusing? Enter info edit box

121
00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:52.010
Marina: so like it doesn't

122
00:11:52.220 --> 00:12:00.389
Marina: give me a lot of info as to what each edit boxes, it just says, Enter info enter info edit.

123
00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:10.109
Marina: Oh, my God! So yeah. When I swipe over to that next thing it says, enter info. It doesn't say exactly what that edit box for?

124
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:17.590
Marina: Got it? There's not enough context, yeah, no context or talk back.

125
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.120
Marina: Enter info edit box

126
00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:33.319
Marina: characters and enter info detected icon down dropdown list. So I don't know if that has any change available. Yeah, I don't know

127
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:37.179
Marina: if it has to do with that dropdown window from earlier.

128
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:44.510
Interviewer: What are you saying like this is completely obstructive to your

129
00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.050
Interviewer: navigation?

130
00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:50.020
Marina: Yeah.

131
00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:52.810
Interviewer: Right? Cause

132
00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:59.500
Marina: again. with talkback, you know, reads certain things.

133
00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:10.440
Marina:  so what I would like to expect to see is, you know, kind of have it. Tell me what what the edit box you know, what I'm supposed to enter in there.

134
00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.700
Marina: But instead of this, says, enter infill.

135
00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.420
Interviewer: and that is ambiguous. Yes.

136
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.360
Interviewer: okay. So let me let me

137
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:29.929
Interviewer: run through like the stuff. First of all the drop down, menu!

138
00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:31.250
Interviewer: It should.

139
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:37.339
Interviewer: It is like empty, and that is why it's not opening up when you're trying to click on it. Right?

140
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.419
Interviewer: So you'll have to create

141
00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:44.180
Interviewer: product category first, or like a budget category first.

142
00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:47.690
Marina: Huh? Okay?

143
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:57.309
Marina: And so basically, from that standpoint. no error messages or nothing popped up, letting me know about that.

144
00:13:58.620 --> 00:13:59.960
Interviewer: Yeah.

145
00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:02.660
Marina: so

146
00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:07.550
Marina: interrupted product category tap. September seventeenth.

147
00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:16.110
Marina: So what I will do. Button is back. Navigation bar is back out of this screen

148
00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:18.989
Marina: and see what I can

149
00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:23.600
Marina: enter. Info edit. September nineteenth. Home, button back

150
00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:32.200
Marina: money manager, add expense, button total your expense. Category more options, month open navigation drawer button.

151
00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:39.140
Marina: so I'll go through that and see if I can figure out how to add categories.

152
00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:47.169
Marina: Come on open navigate and money manager manager budget checked month's expenses.

153
00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.960
budget categories.

154
00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:53.399
Marina: And I see that budget categories, chat budget categories.

155
00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.899
Marina: more options, category name

156
00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:58.030
Marina: project.

157
00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.760
Marina: unlabeled. Button

158
00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:14.630
Marina: discussion. Icon at okay, so even though talkback has its own recognition system. I don't know if you were able to hear what it just did earlier unlabeled button.

159
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:27.689
Marina: Yep, but, detected add button. I think that's what it said. Right? But from a accessibility, standpoint, you know it's still best to you know label, the button.

160
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:37.690
Marina: because sometimes I believe sometimes the image recognition could be inaccurate.

161
00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:40.740
Interviewer: Yep.

162
00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:47.280
Marina: So it's still best to label the button regardless, anyway. So I'm gonna add budget category info

163
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.799

187
00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.309
Marina: you know, adding a category.

188
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:14.080
Interviewer: I think that is mislabeled.

189
00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.230
Marina: Yeah, I think it. That that's a mislabeled button.

190
00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:20.980
Interviewer: And you can press on it to add that editor.

191
00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:27.569

198
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:54.710

Marina: Shopping, 0% slide shopping.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:32.049
Marina: 0 $0, 400 total expenses out of list. 0% slider.

207
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:37.469
Marina: Okay? So I do like how

208
00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:42.219
Marina: there's a part where it says, you know where it's

209
00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:51.000
Marina: talk back is labeling it as a Slider. I do like Howard. You get an idea of where you're at

210
00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:53.609
Marina: in that category.

211
00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:57.170
Marina: Yep.

212
00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:00.490
Marina: 5%. However, Slider.

213
00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:11.489
Marina: I don't know. I don't know if it's a talkback bug or some other kind of book I noticed, though it's easy to actually mess with that Slider.

214
00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:16.070
Marina: Yeah, as you just saw temporarily. Yep.

215
00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:18.480
Interviewer: so I don't know if it's okay, I don't.

216
00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:23.120
Marina: So I don't know if it's a talkback bug or what. So maybe instead of it being

217
00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:32.079
Marina: Slider, maybe some, some other. some other thing. But still. you know, show what percentage you're at.

218
00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:33.440
Interviewer: Yeah.

219
00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:41.580
Marina: $0 total expense. Add expense button button.

220
00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:45.460
Marina: Alright. So I'm gonna hit that button at expense

221
00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.360
Marina: again, like how this is labeled

222
00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:54.370
Marina: Adult tap shopping. Add new transaction product, category

223
00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.810
Marina: Detective. I come down, drop down list shopping

224
00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:03.300
Marina: alright. I didn't add any other categories. So. But I'm still gonna

225
00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.370
Marina: see what happens, anyway.

226
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:09.310
Marina: Pop-up, window shopping and lists.

227
00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:13.870
Marina: annotation, shopping and add new transaction 20.

228
00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:16.390
Marina: And that pop-up does work.

229
00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:19.669
Interviewer: So you just need to be populated

230
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:28.929
Marina: right? So what I mean is, you know, what I wanted to check out is to see if the pop-up window, or whatever whatever it was going to bring up. If that works.

231
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:42.159
Marina: Okay. So now that's enter info edit box detected, icon down. Enter info edit box. So again, the

232
00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:48.689
Marina: edit box, the first one that I'm on it just says, Enter info! It doesn't give me any context.

233
00:21:51.170 --> 00:22:00.159
Interviewer: What do you think it could be? Any context clues you can use? Name my product, name, product, name.

234
00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:07.110
Marina: I will double tap. Great, just lost my place

235
00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:25.950
Marina: expand toolbar. Alright. So I'm gonna say. and just be simple here and type in shoes.

236
00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:34.919
Marina: Shift off shift. Capital d capital HE. Oh, oh, stop share. R.

Marina: period button comma resends button window navigation bar, tap, and hold to long press.

241

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:18.240
Interviewer: based on

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:23.940
Marina: based on the keyboard that popped up.

247
00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:28.180
Interviewer: I see, like a number keeper.

248
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:31.339
Marina: but you know, just for

249
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:36.099
Marina: future, and it would be best to have that.

250
00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:41.250
Marina: you know. Have those edit boxes labeled like the like. They were on the

251
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:44.769

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.010

266
00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.520
Marina: 3, 2023

267
00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:49.679
Marina: free. So previous, free. September fifteenth

268
00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:55.909
Marina: previous month. Button 3, 20, 2023.

269
00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:02.370
Marina: Okay? Oh, okay, let's see what's going on. Transaction 2023

270
00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:04.390
Marina: tap to activate.

271
00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.579
Marina: Huh? That's weird, huh?

272
00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:08.739
Marina: So the first time it

273
00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:18.879
Marina: on the talk back side of things. It said something about tap to change within second time. Right? It said something different. So I'm not sure again, if that's a talk back issue.

274
00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:20.890
Marina: And then

275
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.599
Marina: I noticed also. So you have this distinguished 2023, and then next one over. When I swipe right

276
00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:31.499
Marina: free. September fifteenth, we're not to activate.

277
00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:33.819
Marina: It says, today's date.

278
00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:40.059
Marina: So II guess what I was thinking would happen is it would actually have

279
00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.909
Marina: the full date in there with the month, day and year

280
00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:46.230
Marina: on one button.

281
00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:54.110
Interviewer: So I'm not gonna learn then the day and then

282
00:25:54.690 --> 00:26:01.270
Interviewer: say, you want, say, you wanted to add this expense a day later. So

283
00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:04.960
Interviewer: you would want to do it like fourteenth September.

284
00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.539
Marina: So yesterday's date.

285
00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:10.590
Marina: Okay.

286
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:13.200
Marina: some

287
00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:15.940
Marina: 2023 September fifteenth.

288
00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:21.180
Marina: I'm going to activate. I'm going to double tap on that on the todays date

289
00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:22.849
Marina: select month and day.

290
00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:27.790
Marina: 3, 6, 3, 6,

291
00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.320
Marina: 9,

292
00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.300
Marina: 8, tattoo.

293
00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.740
Marina: September 6, 2023,

294
00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:53.549
Marina: September, September twentieth, 2020 September, September fourteenth, September, September fourteenth, 2023 have to activate town to activate. Okay, so what I do like is on the upper part of the screen we have a calendar view, which is.

295
00:26:54.180 --> 00:27:00.199
Marina: I guess, what I was expecting. However, what's kind of confusing is. There's also a number keyboard

296
00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:04.169
Marina: on the lower half of the screen. So I'm not sure what that's about.

297
00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:10.040
Interviewer: Think the number keyword appeared when you edit the expense.

298
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.830
Marina: and it didn't hide

299
00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:13.350
Interviewer: second.

300
00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.750
Marina: okay, so it must be a bug

301
00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:17.599
Interviewer: could be, yeah.

302
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:21.030
Marina: September fourteenth, 2023,

303
00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.869
Marina: Thursday, September fourteenth, 2023.

304
00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:28.199
Marina: So like September September twelfth, 20.

305
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.279
Marina: So I'm gonna back out of that screen

306
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.090
Marina: keyboard hidden

307
00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:41.650
Marina: the previous month. But who? September 2020. Transaction.

308
00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:43.200

Marina: here, choose, detect product, add new transaction.

Marina: September 9, 23. On September sixth, 150, edit. Box, entering

311
00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:55.720

Marina: tap, choose, edit, detect, product, add view, transaction.

313
00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:10.319
Marina: stop, share, stop share annotation. September 6. Today, September sixteenth, to selected September Thursday, September fourteenth.

314
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:19.339
Marina: September sixth back, button

315
00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:20.910
Marina: add expense, button

316
00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:27.209
Marina: total expense, annotation button at total $0, or $100 in list.

317
00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:30.000
Marina: Okay? So when I hit that.

318
00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:32.110
Interviewer: no, go ahead.

319
00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:40.559
Marina: So when I hit that button there's nothing II was expecting the calendar view to go away and back me, you know. Put me back on the Add screen.

320
00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:46.539
Interviewer: The calendar view was actually part of the air screen.

321
00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:49.010
Marina: and

322
00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:57.910

324
00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:07.860

Marina: selected

346
00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:20.860

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:25.470
Marina: maybe. Going away once you select selected the date.

348
00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:32.540

Interviewer: have you pressed any button to think that it appeared

351
00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:44.849
Interviewer: or right? So what I mean is that it was here.

352
00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:47.880
Marina: Alright. So what I mean is, I selected the

353
00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:51.620
Marina: I said I could be

354
00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:56.869
Marina: but they you know, it was showing today's dates. I selected that to bring up the calendar view.

355
00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:11.010
Interviewer: I see. II think that is where talkback is miss guiding you because the calendar view is actually there, and on the

356
00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:19.980
Marina: today's date, like it was already there. You didn't have to press today's, but but you had mentioned that I was that I should select yesterday's date.

357
00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:21.390
Interviewer: Yeah.

358
00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:29.249
Interviewer:  oh, I thought I thought when it was

359
00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:35.660
Interviewer: saying that you can choose a day and a date

360
00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:40.799

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:31.939

370
00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.819

372
00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:47.329
Marina: annotation, add expense. Button. Okay? So I did all this work, and it still did not add, my.

373
00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:50.910
Marina: I don't know what I'm doing wrong here.

374
00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:56.449
Interviewer: Did you hear the the? Yes, I did. I heard it

375
00:32:56.630 --> 00:33:00.180
Marina: so, I think. Forgotten to add something else.

376
00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:06.670
Interviewer: No, you, Jim, you're you're good, it's not. It's not you. Don't worry. It's the app

377
00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:12.030
Interviewer: requiring certain information, but it's not giving you

378
00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:17.490
Interviewer: the information before. So what the problem here is is that

379
00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:23.010
Interviewer: you have to add income to your wallet first before

380
00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:28.659
Interviewer: you can add a transaction. So can you try finding a way to add income

381
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.780
Marina: shopping and lists, open navigation

382
00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:36.690
Marina: money manager, manage your budget, track your expenses and control your plans.

383
00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:45.190
Marina: checked month's expenses, budget categories, budget analysis. monthly expenses, analysis budget plans.

384
00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:50.590

385
00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:55.360
Marina: month, budget, analysis. budget categories.

386
00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:58.280

387
00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:06.200
Marina: Nova 7 tap to come on one year. Money manager, money manager

388
00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:20.899
Marina: stop sharing. Hmm and project plans. Window money manager. No. So I'm gonna stop here because what I'm because I on talk back, you know, there are different gestures

389
00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:25.190
Marina: that you can use. And so I was using this one that

390
00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:39.940
Marina: basically it's like, make writing a backwards. Now, I think enough to go ask to go back next, to go back to screen, and what it did was obviously took me back to the home screen as opposed to taking me out of the menu

391
00:34:40.449 --> 00:34:44.199
Marina: and put me back on the previous screen I was on.

392
00:34:45.989 --> 00:34:51.130
Interviewer: So the so the bank gesture is being registered, but it is exiting the app.

393
00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:55.770
Interviewer: So if you want to go back to the homes, can you have to click on month expense.

394
00:34:56.489 --> 00:35:04.139
Marina: money management budget category checked month expense, checked months expense. more options. Pop up window

395
00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:12.279

Marina: Battery, 51%. Add to money, amount edit box. Add to your wallet. tap to edit money, amount, edit box annotation, add in some button. So from a talkback perspective on. The first thing I've noticed

401
00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:48.019
Marina: is that the

402
00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:53.160
Marina: money add income button. There's an add income button

403
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:56.750
Marina: and then

404
00:35:56.770 --> 00:36:06.110
Marina: when I swipe right money box. You've got the label edit box group. I guess what I was expecting to see would be the

405
00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:14.079
Marina: add add amounts edit box, and then follow it, and then, when I swipe right. the near adding, Come, button.

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:18.470
Interviewer: so like the traversal order is reversed.

407
00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.100
Marina: Right? That's what I was

408
00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:24.789
Marina: right. So what it looks like right now is, you know, the order is reversed.

409
00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:33.350
Marina: I see what that can assume right now. So I'm going to add.

00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:15.139

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:17.440

458
00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:28.179
Marina: Oh, I'm sorry. Okay, good. Good. Yeah, it's a little on a cumbersome, because there's no straightforward way to get the budget set up to begin with.

459
00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:39.310
Marina: So it didn't. It didn't explain. It didn't say oh, first, you need to add. you know, income, or how much money you have in your wallet.

460
00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:49.620
Marina: and next thing you need to add a category, you know a few categories, and then you can start adding your expenses. It just drops you right into the main screen.

461
00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:57.050
Interviewer: Got it so there has to be some kind of configuration done beforehand.

462
00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:05.270
Marina: But you don't have to keep on doing it all over again. you know, like a first time setup type of thing

463
00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:12.060
Interviewer: in terms of the accessibility.

464
00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:21.500
Marina: So in terms of accessibility. I stated the on the add expense screen. There was no

465
00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:25.830

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:37.169

468
00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:44.550
Got it. Okay?

529
00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:50.659

530
00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:55.189
Marina: any budgets that on the screen.

531
00:46:56.330 --> 00:47:00.780
Interviewer: What is your best as to what those info are?

532
00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:03.679
Marina: What was that?

533
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:09.530
Interviewer: What, sir? Like best? Guess on what that information is trying to convey.

534
00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:20.589
Marina: Well, I'm not exactly sure what it's trying to convey, because. you know, there's no context. So I don't know if it's trying to

535
00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:23.940
Marina: show how the feature works.

536
00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:32.640
Interviewer: So what it actually is doing is very visual. So it is like color coding the plants

537
00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:38.320
Interviewer: that you will list. So it is. There is a green color, and it's

538
00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:41.850
Interviewer: depicting. Your wallet contains enough money.

539
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:46.410
Interviewer: and there's a red color that is depicting the deadline of this color has passed.

540
00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:50.730
Interviewer: and then the rest of the earliest, Rosan.

541
00:47:52.010 --> 00:48:00.550
Marina: Okay, so. But I don't know why. It would show that even when I you know, even before I added a budget plan.

542
00:48:01.610 --> 00:48:03.900
Interviewer: It's it's kind of like

543
00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:12.019
Interviewer: labeling like a legend of this page that is trying to convey that. But because it is

544
00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:14.669
Interviewer: yeah, because it is color-coded.

545
00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:17.580
Interviewer: It is not conveying any info to you.

546
00:48:18.110 --> 00:48:20.120
Marina: Okay, so

547
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:28.379
Marina:  I'm not exactly sure how this would work for talkback users.

548
00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:35.290
Marina: for I'm thinking, have some kind of a

549
00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:39.819
Marina: color code, you know, color code systems that.

550
00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:44.519
Marina: or at least some kind of system that works specifically with talk back like.

551
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:46.609
Marina: you know, like an asterisk.

552
00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:51.110
Marina: the notes

553
00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:54.679
Marina: the due date being passed, and I don't know what else.

554
00:48:56.370 --> 00:48:59.399
Interviewer: Some kind of alternative way to convey that link.

555
00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:06.059
Marina: Yes, that's what I'm trying to look at is a an alternative way to convey the same information.

556
00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:19.139
Interviewer: Okay, next, there are 2 ways that the app is analyzing your data. So can we go into the and analysis.

557
00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:29.140
Marina: the depth, your wallet, open navigation drawer, button money manager months expenses, budget categories, budget analysis.

558
00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:35.889
Marina: So this, what? I'm so is this the first one? Yeah, this is the first one

559
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:43.890
Marina: chat budget analysis. Okay, so this is gonna be tricky, because if there are charts involved

560
00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:50.579
Marina: with my experiences with the charts, information is not really conveyed. Well.

561
00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:53.730
Interviewer: how do you know that there's charts involved?

562
00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:56.389
Marina: Well, because of the

563
00:49:57.070 --> 00:50:03.170
Marina: contacts clues. You know it said, budget analysis. So my impression is that I'm gonna be

564
00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:07.100
Marina: coming across a chart. Once I double tap.

565
00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:13.699

Marina: So

584
00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:38.020
Marina: so just as I.

585
00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:41.460
Marina: So this is, I thought the chart

586
00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:47.269
Marina: even though, you know, I've only added one entry. So it's kinda

587
00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:51.260
Marina: hard to figure out what's going on. But

588
00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:58.749
Marina: at the beginning it sounded promising, because, you know, was telling me. Hey, there's one data point.

589
00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:04.409
Marina: And then, as I moved on as I swept right.

590
00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:10.150
Marina: it's just sounds like it was just reading a bunch of numbers.

591
00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:15.080
Marina: you know, without me knowing what those numbers are. or how to

592
00:52:16.090 --> 00:52:18.879
Marina: used in calculating the budget, or whatever.

593
00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:23.060
Interviewer: What do you think a better alternative would be

594
00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:26.710
Marina:  So

595
00:52:26.850 --> 00:52:32.180
Marina: I've discovered at least a few times like these. A.

596
00:52:33.210 --> 00:52:35.849
Marina: There's these charts out there

597
00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:41.860
Marina: where I guess, somehow, notice. If you're a screen reader user, it describes the chart in detail.

598
00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:46.660
Marina: I'm not exactly sure what it's called

599
00:52:48.090 --> 00:52:49.360
Marina: right?

600
00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:58.120

602
00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:07.640

645
00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:46.760
Interviewer: Can you can you list me some of the like. You already listed some of the excellent issues from like adding transaction. Can you list again afterwards, like what other issues you face afterwards.

646
00:56:48.970 --> 00:56:56.139
Marina: So do we need me to stop screen sharing, or

647
00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:59.350
Interviewer: we're still we don't. We don't need that. We don't need this

648
00:56:59.530 --> 00:57:06.919
Marina: okay screen off. Bring her silent. Okay, so so what was your question again?

649
00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:10.339
Interviewer: So what's your review of that?

650
00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:12.920
Marina: So

651
00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:20.279
Marina:  my review is a although it's a pretty good.

652
00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:23.110
Marina: Yeah, although it's a good app.

653
00:57:24.590 --> 00:57:27.560
Marina: I noticed talking like I noticed that

654
00:57:28.030 --> 00:57:31.700
Marina: it's there's no

655
00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:34.610
Marina: onboarding or introduction.

656
00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:47.180
Marina: like, you know. But you know, hey? You need to add some things before you know you can start adding expenses. It just drops you into the monthly expenses, screen

657
00:57:49.050 --> 00:57:54.059
Marina:  and then, on the accessibility side of things.

658
00:57:54.650 --> 00:58:00.169
Marina: I don't like how I'm not able to view the charts in an accessible manner.

659
00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:10.109
Marina:  I'm also don't like how the monthly expenses. Analysis, how I'm not able to use that at all.

660
00:58:12.790 --> 00:58:18.199
Marina: Like, basically, if I was really serious about budget tracking, I'd have to go through whatever means

661
00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:19.900
Marina: to a

662
00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:24.529
Marina: like. I'd be better off just using that an excel spreadsheet.

663
00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:29.840
Marina: for if I wanted to get an in-depth analysis of my budget.

664
00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:42.540
Marina: but other than that, at least. What I do like, though, is on the monthly expenses. How it kind of gives you a visual

665
00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:46.129
Marina: overview of where you're at for each category

666
00:58:46.410 --> 00:58:54.100
Marina: so like a shopping category. Once I entered the choose and get price and all that I like how to

667
00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:58.560
Marina: attracts how it told me. Oh, you're

668
00:59:00.070 --> 00:59:06.649
Marina: at 38, you know, per cents. This is from a talk back point of view. So I like how you know. It shows that

669
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:14.539
Marina: although the part I found interesting is because it uses a slider as opposed to something else.

670
00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:18.730
Marina: That you could just change the Slider.

671
00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:30.899
Marina: Yeah, that's like the main thing I like about it. And then, when it comes to the analysis. you know, so I'm not able to

672
00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:34.039
Marina: fully utilize that feature.

673
00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:37.790
Interviewer: Got it

674
00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:41.889
Interviewer: there. Anything else? Or

675
00:59:42.090 --> 00:59:44.010
Marina: I think that's it.

676
00:59:44.310 --> 00:59:46.780
Interviewer: Okay, great. Thank you so much.

677
00:59:47.010 --> 00:59:55.390
Interviewer: And just as a disclaimer this app is open source. So we modified it a bit. And there.

678
00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:59.860
Interviewer: the main app doesn't have as many exclusive issues. So

679
01:00:00.410 --> 01:00:15.079
Interviewer: I'm sure you want to use that app or buzzer tracking and give it a try. Alright correct. And thank you for your time and the valuable insights. Hope you have a great day and a great weekend

680
01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:16.540
Interviewer: right

681
01:00:16.690 --> 01:00:17.750
Marina: right?
