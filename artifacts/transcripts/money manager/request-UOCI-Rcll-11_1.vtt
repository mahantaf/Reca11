00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.610
Matt: Hi, my name is Matt.

2
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:11.519
Matt: And today I'm going to be performing the task. SGT.

3
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.570
Matt: Tracking your expenses with money manager number 4,

4
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.509
Matt: and the slug

5
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.230
Matt: is

6
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.009
Matt: UOCI.

7
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.790
Matt: Dash RCLL. Dash 1 1.

8
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.779
Matt: And for the task today I'll be using a Google Pixel 6

9
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.879
Matt: running the latest version of Android 14, and the latest version of Talkback.

10
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.230
Matt: which I believe is 14.1.

11
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:57.039
Matt: My task today, while using the app, I'm going to be creating some expense categories and adding my income. I'm going to add some expenses and transactions.

12
00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.650
Matt: and I need to keep in mind that I cannot spend

13
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.180
Matt: more than my income, and I will be checking in to see

14
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.980
Matt: how much total that I have spent. Finally, I'm I'm going to edit one of the

15
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:27.280
Matt: Budget categories to change the name or budget and save it. Next, I'm going to create a budget plan and add a a deadline for any day next month. And lastly, I'm going to check out the 2 analysis results.

16
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.460
Matt: So let's get started. Shall we? First, I'm going to

17
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.470
Matt: create

18
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.000
Matt: an expense category

19
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.109
Matt: and add an income. So I'm going to create about 2

20
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:48.700
Matt: 2 categories. For this example, I'm going to create a food cat groceries, category and a

21
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.030
Matt: entertainment or recreation category.

22
00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:01.780
Matt: So what I'm going to do is I'm going to be using a mixture of braille for typing, as it's my preferred method as well as swiping with my

23
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:12.769
Matt: fingers on the phone. But I'll be giving instructions as I navigate along. I'll generally be using a lot of left and right swiping as well as double tapping

24
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.000
Matt: to make selections. So I am at the main screen.

25
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.749
Matt: I'm just going to jump over to the app

26
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.180
Matt: now. So at the moment open navigation join

27
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.490
Matt: talkback announces open navigation drawer

28
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:37.969
Matt: month's expenses, and I'm just swiping to the right. It says, month, month expenses, more options, but we have a more options, category date.

29
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.310
Matt: and then it says, category, name your expenses this month. Your expenses. This month total expenses.

30
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:53.890
Matt: total expenses add expense, button. add expense. Button. Now. from what I see here, it it doesn't appear that there's anything available to me.

31
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.139
Matt: Yet. It would be nice if it sort of had a

32
00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.609
Matt: dialog that came up and said, Hey, just so, you know you. There's no expenses as of yet. So what I'm going to do. Annotation. But

33
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.179
Matt: add expense. Button is naturally I'm expense.

34
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.230
Matt: Button.

35
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.130
Matt: By double tapping on my screen.

36
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:29.459
Matt: add product, category, dropdown list detected icon down image animation.

37
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.539
Matt: money manager, total expense. At first it didn't look like it. Did anything so add expense button.

38
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.010
Matt: I'm going to double tap again on add expense.

39
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:52.689
Matt: and in braille it's a transaction on a category. Ok. In braille. I was going to state, it says, add new transaction. But talkback did not immediately speak.

40
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.620
Matt: It actually took a few seconds for it to

41
00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.410
Matt: start speaking. Which made me think it didn't do anything.

42
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.389
Matt: So we're now in the product category

43
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:27.400
Matt: detected. IC product category. And I don't know if this is an element I can interact with. So this is a dropdown. So I'm going to

44
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.199
Matt: guess that this is something I can interact with. So I'm going to

45
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.730
Matt: and activate it now.

46
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:45.719
Matt: which I've now done. But there's no speech, and there's no either input on the braille display. Enter info any box.

47
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:54.060
Matt: Okay? So doesn't look like I can interact with this drop down. It's sort of misleading here. Product category.

48
00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:01.120
Matt: So enter info in a box is this, enter info characters, enter 0 10

49
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.760
Matt: 0 of 10 characters. Answer. Info in a box

50
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.999
Matt: transaction. Thank you.

51
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.400
Matt: 2,024. Okay, trans. Enter characters enter, enter info

52
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.660
Matt: detected icon. So before I get

53
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:20.500
Matt: any further, I'm going to try once more to activate this dropdown. And it looks like I can't.

54
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.339
Matt: December fourteenth in a box. I guess I'll have to just detect it.

55
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:38.619
Matt: I apologize for the pause there. I just needed some clarification as to where I was. So it actually looks like this was a transaction screen

56
00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.730
Matt: and so ignore. But

57
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.500
Matt: I apologize, Buddy Badger.

58
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.640
Matt: So it actually looks like I am

59
00:05:48.080 --> 00:06:00.740
Matt: not in the right spot. It looks like when you hit add expense. I was adding a transaction which was very misleading, so I'm going to examine the navigation drawer, and I'm going to double, tap and activate it here.

60
00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.159
Matt: Money manager, manage your budget, track your expenses and control your plans.

61
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:12.209
Matt: Okay? So it says, money manager, manage your budget. track your expenses and control your plans.

62
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.799
Matt: and I'm going to swipe to the right month's expenses checked.

63
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.390
Matt: So looks like. These are a check box that says monthly expenses is checked. Budget categories.

64
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:31.970
Matt: We have budget categories, budget analysis. budget analysis, monthly expenses, analysis. monthly expenses, analysis, budget plans.

65
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:41.820
Matt: budget plans, annotation button. And then that is it. So? I'm going to assume that the budget categories

66
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.010
Matt: is the correct spot

67
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.730
Matt: budget analysis, budget categories.

68
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.639
Matt: It would be a nice if it is, in fact, the correct option.

69
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.919
Matt: if it would be labeled as the

70
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.939
Matt: expense categories. If this is in fact, the correct option. So I'm gonna hit

71
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.850
Matt: the checkbox here. Double tap, check open navigation door

72
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.129
Matt: talkback says, checked, and immediately drops me into this

73
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:09.639
Matt: screen again budget categories. And now it's changed from

74
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.250
Matt: monthly expenses to budget categories.

75
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.880
Matt: Category name gotcha

76
00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.200
Fab

77
00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:32.189
Matt: detected icon add annotation button detected. Icon add add budget. But it's actually unlabeled. Category name. So let's double tap on category name. First, let's do more options.

Matt: Pop-up window your wallet. Add income

79

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.080

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.730
Matt: come is

84
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.920
Matt: let's use 25

85
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:15.210
Matt: 100 a month and click done. 1,500 keyboard hidden keyboard is now hidden, and in this edit box should be

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:24.220
Matt: budget. and I got out of the accident. There. I'm just going to add in them.

88
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.240
Matt: Add to your wallet, add income.

89
00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.199
Matt: Try that again. Money manager, more options.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:33.039
Matt: pop-up window your wallet.

91
00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:35.260
Matt: add income, add to your wallet.

92
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.069
Matt: stop, share button.

93
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.470
Matt: add in my amount in a box.

94
00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.449
Matt: Okay, so let's try this one more time

95
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:44.490
Matt: showing Braille keyboard. English comma.

96
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:48.690
Matt: Actually, we're gonna type in 2,500 again.

97
00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:50.640
0.

98
00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:58.049
Matt: And that's done. I'm going to hit done on my display. 2,500 keyboard hidden. Ok, I got the confirmation from talkback.

99
00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:02.980
Matt: And now I'm going to activate the Add income button.

100
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:08.449
Matt: Your wallet contains now 2,500.0 money manager. More options.

101
00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:20.550
Matt: Excellent! Excellent. I love when things let you know that you have successfully added, especially for money apps like this. So great work with that nice to have that announcement.

102
00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:30.869
Matt: And now that our income is added, we're going to add the 2 categories. So I said before, we're going to add an entertainment category and a groceries category.

103
00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:34.249
Matt: So I'm going to find that category name.

104
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:38.600
Matt: and I want to see if I can just hit the category name here.

105
00:09:41.060 --> 00:10:04.329
Matt: and it doesn't appear to do anything. Budget. So let's add, detected icon add image icon on a green background. Description, accuracy, medium. So this is. This is an unlabeled button. Talkback does identify it. However, in Braille it does not have any label. It just says unlabeled button. So it's important to remember to label buttons so that everyone knows what is, in fact, going on

106
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.070
Matt: So if I double tap this, I can add.

107
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.010
and

108
00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:11.960
Matt: a category. So it's at our first category, which would be groceries.

109
00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:20.650
Matt: budget, category info category name data box category name. So we're gonna type in for this one. We're gonna type in groceries

110
00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:27.729
Matt: showing braille, keyboard. English braille, United States bear expedition. Okay, I'll type in groceries.

111
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.929
Dot say, GROC, ERIE, S.

112
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:36.550
Matt: Okay, and I'm going to navigate

113
00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:44.329
Matt: and activate the next button growth budget. Write the maximum amount of money you can spend in this category edit box editing.

115
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:49.469

Matt: Budget right? The maximum amount of money you can spend in this category data box. Okay, I'm gonna activate the set of box here showing Braille keyboard, English braille, United States American edition.

117
00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:11.929
Matt: and I'm going to say. For groceries that I can spend $350 a month. So I'll type in

118
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:16.229
Matt: 3, 5, 0 3, 5 0 and click done

119
00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.950
Matt: so. 350 keyboard hidden.

120
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:23.710
Matt: Alright. I'm going to swipe to the right

121
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:27.440
Matt: clear text. Write the maximum amount of money you can spend in this category.

122
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:28.840
Matt: Okay, there's data

123
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:30.689
Matt: prompt there, add income

124
00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.220
Matt: adaptation, add income.

125
00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:40.230
Matt: Now, I thought we had added the income. But I'm hoping this will just add the category.

126
00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:45.220
Matt:  So if this is, in fact, adding the categories a little misleading.

127
00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.599
Matt: let's see what happens when I activate it.

128
00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:52.710

Matt: spoke. But it did bring me back to the screen. $350.

132
00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.769
Matt: Sesame's okay. And I'm just wiping to the right. Perfect. Okay?

133
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:18.680
Matt: Wonderful. So it did add. But it would be nice to get get an announcement that the category groceries was added with a

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:24.920
Matt: spending of, and I'm going to add one more category detected icon image

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:08.880
Matt: It says, 1350 characters. Budget. Write the maximum amount of money you can spend in this category edit box editing. Okay

144
00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:20.800

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:47.480
Matt: Okay, it's it's not necessary to have the prompt here twice as talk back already has announced it. It's just extra swiping that one needs to do

150
00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:51.129
Matt: So I'm going to click add income, which again would be nice that this

151
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.889
Matt:  would speak once I click it.

236
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:29.449

237

240
00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.009
Matt: so I

241
00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:57.329

242
00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:01.460
Matt: for grocery wise, either item by item, or

243
00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:05.430

Matt: grocery day.

245
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:11.750
Matt: So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to add another expense.

246
00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:17.300
Matt: And we're gonna go to the drop-down.

247

251
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:34.840
Matt: add new transaction.

252
00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:46.879
Matt: Taking a little bit to engage here. Okay, we've got product category detected. Icon down entertainment box. Okay, enter info. So this should be the name of the

253
00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:49.100
Matt: product. So we're going to add

254
00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:54.010

SN.

258
00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.090
Matt: It's less great accent

259
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:04.650
right? Accepting

260
00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.010

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:33.929
Matt: image animation. I'm going to type in $20

266
00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:41.749
Matt: dots 2, 5, 6, and a period, and let's do 95 cents

267
00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:43.350
5. And I delete

268
00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:49.049
Matt: dot 3, 9. Okay, and I'll click done

269
00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:56.469
Matt: simple. 20,495 keyboard hidden dot 20,000. So that actually didn't work as I was expecting

270
00:23:56.620 --> 00:24:03.780
Matt:  And that may be because I'm just typing in braille showing Briokeeper. It does. It was supposed to say

271
00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:10.799
Matt: $20 and 95 cents. I'm going to see if I can fix this.

272
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.920
Matt: That's 4, 6, and that's 4, 6, 7.

273
00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:18.899
You delete. I believe it.

274
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:23.940
Matt: $20.

275
00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:30.790
Matt: So let's say.

276
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:40.520
Matt: oops, not type in braille anymore. Oops. that's 3, 4, 5, 0. So let's say, it's $20 and 20 cents

277
00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:42.210
20. Okay?

278
00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:47.860
Matt: And I think we have the same, yeah, with the same results. So what I'm going to do

279
00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.419
Matt: is I'm going to

280
00:24:51.710 --> 00:25:00.610
Matt: see if I can. For some reason, not typing in 0 to the decimal point. I'm going to try one more time submitting text

281
00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:04.760
Matt: transaction data.

282
00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:06.940
Matt: clear text, don't resign

283
00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:12.199
Matt: 20.2 0. Okay, 20,435 data books.

284
00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.699
24, 2, 0.

285
00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:14.920
Matt: Okay, it

286
00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:19.609
Matt: looks like it did work. So this is no fault of the app. It's just the fault of

287
00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:24.210
Matt: my braille display and a little bit of unsure

288
00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:26.650
Matt: uncertainty of the way to type.

289
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:39.070
Matt: But that is no fault of the the app. So if you've got $20 and 20 cents, and my Disney plus subscription comes out every fifth

290
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:46.169
Matt: of the month. So we're gonna go.

291
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:52.170
Matt: Monday, February fifth, 2,024. Selected. Okay? And I'm going to go to the bottom of the screen.

292
00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:57.559
Matt: The seventh of February the 20 seventh of, because there should be an ad transaction right

293
00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:02.269
Matt: after the last day of the month. the 20 eighth of the 20 ninth of February

294
00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:10.180
Matt: add transaction. Okay, so right, as I got to the 20 ninth of February and swiped to the right the ad transaction button

295
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:18.130
Matt: took a little bit of time to appear and speak as well. It took about a second or 2. So I'm gonna activate the add transaction button

296
00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:31.050
Matt: transaction budget category equals 2 production equals apostrophe. Disney price equals to 0 point 2 by date equals Monday, February fifth, 1310, and 25,B s Eastern Standard time, 2,024 money manager add expense. Button.

297
00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:35.120
Matt: Okay? So a couple things.

298
00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:39.509
Matt: It would be nice if, because this was a recurrent subscription.

299
00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:43.139
Matt: and maybe we can sort this out in the budget area.

300
00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:48.569
Matt: But at the moment it doesn't appear to be a way to have it tell that it's a recurring

301
00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:52.589
Matt: subscription and also the the way it spoke

302
00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:57.680
Matt: everything was a bit much. It was talking about product label equals and

303
00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:07.069
Matt: amount equals. It would be nice to just say, you know, you have, added Disney, with the amount of $20 and 20 cents to the entertainment category for February fifth

304
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:10.219
Matt: of 2024.

305
00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:14.789
Matt:  okay. My next part of the task

306
00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.680
Matt: is

307
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:20.480
Matt: I'm going to edit one of the budget categories

308
00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:25.240
Matt: and changed the name or budget. And then I'm going to save it.

309
00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:31.560
Matt: Okay? So we're gonna try this. So let's go all the way to the left side.

310
00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:42.330
Matt: Open navigation, join open up the money manager, manage your budget expenses and control months, expensive budget categories.

311
00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:46.310
Matt: check open navigation drawer budget categories, more options.

312
00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:56.350
Matt: And I actually just realized we didn't add anything into the food category. But that's fine. We're going to change it. To a different name. Category name

313
00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:59.070
Matt: budget cosmies.

314
00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:02.130
Matt: $350. Entertainment.

315
00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:03.900
Matt: $250

316
00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:06.429
Matt: food. Now, if I activate this

317
00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:11.050
Matt: budget category info food, Eddie box perfect.

318
00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:15.610
Matt: That's exactly what I was hoping to happen is that it would have brought up this particular dialogue.

319
00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:18.589
Matt: And I'm going to activate this with the double tap

320
00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:28.090
Matt: food. You cannot change the category name showing Braille keyboard. English Braille, United States American edition. Okay? So I don't know why it won't let me change the category name.

321
00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:37.169
Matt: and it doesn't give a reason why characters enter 250 point clear text. But but if I clear the text

322
00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:47.649
Matt: food edit box editing, and it's category, name category.

323
00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:52.060
Matt: Write the maximum amount, add income rail display input food.

324
00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:56.150
Matt: Yeah, that's very odd. Okay, let's try one more thing.

325
00:28:56.390 --> 00:29:03.389
Matt: Keyboard hidden. Write them a budget. Write the Mac characters, enter food data box category, name budget, category and phone

326
00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:05.210
Matt: food.

327
00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:08.299
Matt: I'm going to do a double tap and hold

328
00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:11.919
Matt: which normally brings up some other items.

329
00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:24.150
Matt: Actions move cursor to beginning. I have actions for talkback move cursor to end, which I have a customer for. Start on and select cancel, and I can't do any editing here.

330
00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:37.250
Matt:  food budget category. Category.

331
00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:47.719
Matt: stop sharing money. Manager goes this way. Let's try the entertainment category 200 entertainment. So I'll activate this

332
00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:50.070
Matt: budget category and phone entertainment

333
00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:56.330
Matt: entertainment. You cannot change the category name. So for some reason, it's not allowing me to change the

334
00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:01.600
Matt: category name, and I'm not sure why. And there's no error, message.

335
00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:04.330
Matt: or explanation as to why

336
00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:08.900
Matt:  so unfortunately, I wasn't able to complete this part of the task.

337
00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:10.440
Matt: But what I can do

338
00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:11.420
keep okay

339
00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:15.609
Matt: is, I will move on to the next

340
00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:19.360
Matt: option, which is to create a budget plan.

341
00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:26.200
Matt: And I'm going to add a deadline for any day in March, which is the next month from today.

342
00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:30.540
Matt: So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go back into the drawer

343
00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:34.610
Matt: budget category and stop share

344
00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:43.920
Matt: budget cap. Evidently I'm not. I need to go back a level. So I'm gonna do a down with left of my phone.

345
00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:55.630
Matt: Okay? So I'm back on the screen, the home screen of the app. And so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to activate the At navigation drawer

346
00:30:56.380 --> 00:31:07.220
Matt: budget, category name or option budget, category, open navigation. money, manager, manager expenses, budget categories, budget analysis.

Matt: budget plans, budget plans and activate here.

349
00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:20.280
Matt: check open navigation drawer, budget plans, more options. Your wallet contains enough money for this plan.

350
00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:23.739
Matt: Wonderful. Your wallet contains enough money for this plan.

351
00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:26.749

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:44.439
Matt: Okay. So it just says, your edit. Your wallet contains enough money for this plan. The deadline of this plan has passed.

356
00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:56.439
Matt: The deadline of this plan has passed, but there's no indication as to what detected Icon image. Oh, icon! As to what this is. So I'm guessing it's blank, but the deadline.

357
00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.880
Matt: If I click it, it doesn't do anything. Check it, so let me hit. Add

363
00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:24.169
Matt: And I'll activate next.

364
00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:37.800
Matt: But plan description Edgons editing. I'm not quite sure what to type in here. It's not giving me any info as to what I could type. It would be really helpful for those of us who are new to this kind of thing.

365
00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:42.389
Matt: What they can type in here. I'll just type my

366
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:48.529
Matt: about monthly budget and activate. Next

367
00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:53.610

Matt: characters entered 17 of 50 plans budget and a box plans, budget plan, deadline date. I have no idea what that is. Plans.

369
00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:05.500
Matt: plans, budget edit box.

370
00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:14.640
Matt: I'm guessing. Characters enter clear text. My monthly budget plans budget. Okay, that's dollar sign. Okay, that's the dollar sign. So I'm going to put 3 50

371
00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:23.350
Matt: for you know. Let's do 800. Once I've done 800. Okay.

372
00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:25.760
Matt: dollar sign. There's no

373
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:39.269
Matt: real info here. As to what I'm supposed to do. So your text sort of guessing here, plan, deadline date plan, deadline date. So we're going to do march 2,024, Wednesday, February 20 previous, next month, button to activate next month.

374
00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:42.809
Matt: page 1491 of 2,412.

375
00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:48.280
Matt: So it would have been nice if it would have said now, in March

376
00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:52.240
Matt: previous Wednesday, February 20, eighth previous, next month.

377
00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:55.090
Matt: the first of March 2,024.

378
00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:58.480
Matt: So let's choose any day.

379
00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:10.290
Matt: The nineteenth, the twentieth of March 2, tha. Wednesday, March twentieth, 2,024. Selected. Okay. March the twentieth, and we're going to go to the bottom of the screen.

380
00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:11.370
Matt: I plan.

381
00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:26.889
Matt: Go ahead and add our plan. Your plan added successfully. Money manager detected icon, add image icon on a green background. Description medium. Okay, I did get the Ver notification and verification that the plan was added successfully.

382
00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.070
Matt: and the final part of the task

383
00:34:29.219 --> 00:34:32.530
Matt: is, we're going to look at the analysis sections.

384
00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:41.879
Matt: So I just wanna check and make sure. This actually went through monthly budget. My monthly budget. Wednesday, March twentieth.

385
00:34:41.989 --> 00:34:45.199
Matt: I'm just wiping the left. The deadline of this plan has passed.

386
00:34:45.469 --> 00:34:57.770
Matt: The deadline of this plan has passed which that is incorrect, because the deadline is March. Your wallet contains enough money for this plan, so I'm a little confused there. But I digress. Let's go into the menu. Your wallet

387
00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:00.660
Matt: budget plans, open navigation

388
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.920
Matt: money back. And we're going to find the analysis.

389
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:12.160
Matt: Month expense, budget budget analysis. So we have 2. We have the budget analysis monthly expenses, analysis and the expenses. Let's do

390
00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:14.129
Matt: the budget analysis first

391
00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:19.210
Matt: activate open navigation drawer. And here we are. Logic analysis.

392
00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:23.020
Matt: more options. Webview. So this looks like a.

393
00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:27.139
Matt: It's called a Webview, which is a web document

394
00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:34.360
Matt: pie chart, entitled Your Expenses per Category this month, with 2 points. Mean value is 20 Max. Value is 175 article.

395
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:39.920
Matt: Okay, we've got a data chart here, and I call trial version length. And I caught food

396
00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:42.180
Matt: resonance

397
00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:45.920
Matt: entertainment. So we have my different categories, food

398
00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:49.789
Matt: 0 slash 0 for more information.

399
00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:56.379
Matt: Visit our website, annotation button, which for more information, it's not showing all of my

400
00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:58.940
Matt: expenses. 0 slash 0.

401
00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:03.379
Matt: I wonder if I have to activate each category food. Let's see, entertainment

402
00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.200
food

403
00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:14.780
Matt: entertain. So I activated food 0 slash 0 entitled.

404
00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:20.070
Matt: Do it correctly. That's that's a little unfortunate. 5 more options.

405
00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:23.569
Matt: budget analysis, open navigation. Let me check the

406
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.620
Matt: monthly expenses, analysis expenses. budget budget analysis.

407
00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:30.339
Matt: monthly expenses, analysis.

408
00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:36.210
Matt: check open navigation to monthly, more options. Webview. And we have another web document

409
00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:42.429
Matt: citation button web view, and it looks like it's empty, or it looks like it just skips over it.

410
00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.720
Matt: Webu window money manager.

411
00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:52.090
Matt: He has a talkback, doesn't read anything here. and it's almost as if it doesn't

412
00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:57.220
Matt: have anything inside. It's an empty web document, because if I swipe to the right it gives me back to my

413
00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:59.030
Matt: zoom. Video controls.

414
00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:09.550
Matt:  overall. I wasn't able to complete a few of the tasks. But the adding experience was decent.

415
00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:11.890
Matt: I think some labeling could be

416
00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:24.899
Matt: helpful, and some descriptions could be really helpful for those of us who aren't familiar the the appropriate info to type in for budgets and and things like that. the the the calendar is great.

417
00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:30.210
Matt: it's it's easy to use. I was able to completely, accessibly activate

418
00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:41.049
Matt: the buttons. Some confirmation would be nice for going to the next previous months. It just said page 1,000 of 2,000 and something which doesn't give me any context.

419
00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:44.890
Matt: and also

420
00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:49.499
Matt: any confirmation messages of of adding

421
00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:51.940
Matt: budgets and and

422
00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:57.360
Matt: it did. It did announce a couple of things, but it could be a bit better if it had some more

423
00:37:57.450 --> 00:37:59.470
Matt: confirmation that things were added

424
00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:10.579
Matt: as well as the unlabeled buttons for the add button and the unlabeled info for these analysis. Especially for this last one here

425
00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:13.700
Matt: of the monthly expenses where it's essentially looks like it's empty.

426
00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:20.660
Matt: and I don't know visually on screen, it's empty. But according to my speech and braille, there's nothing here.

427
00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:24.930
Matt:  But I want to thank you for listening

428
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:33.680
Matt: to this task today and taking the time to listen to the accessibility review today. So thank you very much for for watching.
