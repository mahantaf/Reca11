caitlin: LL. Dash 1, 2.

10
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:43.819
caitlin: Hello! My name is Caitlin. I'm blind, and the assistive technology that I'll be using to day is talkback on my android phone. and the app that I'll be working with is money manager, and

11
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.410
caitlin: I will be doing doing a lot to day.

12
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.370
caitlin: But basically tracking expenses and

13
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.800
caitlin: yeah, overall tracking expenses

14
00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.710
caitlin: to give you a brief overview. How I use my screen, reader, I primarily sorry primarily navigate via swiping

15
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.059
caitlin: right to move down through the screen left, to move up to the screen

16
00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.250
caitlin: down and up to navigate by specific elements.

17
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.990
caitlin: and

18
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.730
caitlin: to interact with with elements, links, buttons, etc.

19
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:25.429
caitlin: I double tap occasionally. The double tap does not respond to double tap again. That's not a problem with the app. That's a talkback quark.

20
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.450
caitlin: Trying to think there's anything else I missed. I don't think so. If I do anything else with it, I'll definitely let you know.

21
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.270
caitlin: Okay, so our first step is to create some expense categories

22
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.610
caitlin: and add an income. I'll be holding my phone up at an odd ankle.

23
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:42.500
caitlin: my manager.

24
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:50.970
caitlin: because I can't share my internal audio through zoom on android. So let's swipe to the right here.

25
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.740
caitlin: Oh, it's in landscape.

26
00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:05.139
caitlin: No next heading, no video setting. Tuck my under there. Okay, now, you should board one. Consequences. Open navigation to one. Okay, accessibility is set to be 5%.

27
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.530
caitlin: One sixes open navigation door, but open navigation, draw button

28
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:23.439
caitlin: months, expenses, button more options, button. I'm just trying to get the layout of land here. I'm just looking to the right category. Name your expenses this month.

29
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.490
caitlin: next time, bye?

30
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.469
caitlin: At expense. Okay, perfect. Add expense is the one I'm looking for

31
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.690
caitlin: built up. Have any transaction. Okay, Mike.

32
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.949
caitlin: product category, almost. I go. Now, drop down, list, double tap.

33
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.230
caitlin: and it's not registered. Little tab.

34
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.849
caitlin: I don't forget box. Get it back down, drop down list.

35
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:59.869
caitlin: It's interesting that there's a drop down box here as well as enter info, and it's an edit field. I wonder if once I start adding categories.

36
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.289
caitlin: then maybe that'll be something I can select there. I'm not sure. Characters enter 0 10 entering box.

37
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:15.860
caitlin: Okay, it's a little confusing here when I'm supposed to enter. But I'm going to enter something hopefully that'll create our category. We will. We will find out double time

38
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.969
caitlin: to let you know how I type on the keyboard. I slide my finger across the screen and lift when I find the letter that I want.

39
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:34.970
caitlin: Okay, tucked in food. Now I'm going to tap with a single finger in the middle top of the screen and go ahead. Box. I drink a window at new transaction.

40
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.680
caitlin: Okay, I think it said, food? Oh, sounds good.

41
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.930
caitlin: That's face I love fit on the app. That's face. Oh, yeah.

42
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.920
caitlin: that takes

43
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.790
caitlin: that's face. Okay?

44
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.289
caitlin: Well, we'll try it again. Okay. F,

45
00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.620
caitlin: okay. Touching the little screen. Perfect. Says food switch to the right.

46
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:11.039
caitlin: Clear text, button, clear text button switch to the right characters. Enter 4 of 10, swift to the right.

47
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.859
caitlin: Enter info edit box. Not sure what that means. And that's me.

48
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.400
caitlin: Transaction date. Oh, you can actually add transactions from here. That's interesting.

49
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.410
caitlin: 2024, hmm. 2024.

50
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:38.899
caitlin: Okay, the app said to add categories and income. So I'm trying to just add categories. I'm trying to go in the order which the directions say. So let's see if we can touch to the top of the screen. Okay? So back to the left.

51
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:45.610
caitlin: Okay, add you concession. Oh, this is a new transaction. Oh, part of category.

52
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.810
caitlin: You touch it, mic, down, drop down list. Have your transaction.

53
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.959
caitlin: Let's swipe back the screen.

54
00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.949
caitlin: I did not work. So I back a screen. There we go.

55
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.059
caitlin: I try and forget a box. I'm going to turn.

56
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.209
caitlin: Okay. It had to hide the keyboard first.

57
00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.259
caitlin: And now you just want.

58
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.710
caitlin: Come on. Okay.

59
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:12.840
caitlin: But navigation format.

60
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:24.650
caitlin: Okay? Hmm. Russia's fun cory name. I'm not sure if category or add categories will be under a menu or more options. Let's try more options.

61
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:27.530
caitlin: Koala.

62
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:36.840
caitlin: Add income. Okay? Well, that's a good place to know where that is settings settings. Okay, when you're back.

63
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.799
caitlin: Censor this one toilet census

64
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:51.899
caitlin: total expenses add expense. Oh, just say add expense. I'm so sorry I didn't. I thought it. Just add category. Name. Hmm.

65
00:05:52.270 --> 00:06:01.900
caitlin: How do you add categories? Maybe under the menu is open. I have a decade navigation drawer. It'd be more helpful if this open navigation drawer said.

66
00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:08.990
caitlin: like menu button, because open navigation drawer is. I don't actually know what that means. So double tap

67
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:17.239
caitlin: expenses, budget categories, double tap

68
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.630
auditory.

69
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.270
caitlin: Oh, oh, I think I see. Okay.

70
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:29.150
caitlin: Category name budget unlabeled. Oh, so this is an unlabel button.

71
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:36.289
caitlin: and because it's in the same place as the add expenses was I'm gonna assume it says add.

72
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.530
caitlin: but I'm not sure.

73
00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.159
caitlin: So let's double tap

74
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:41.460
caitlin: budget category. Info.

75
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:52.459
caitlin: yay, category name. Okay. I apologize for my confusion. That was that's kind of on me because I didn't realize it, said add expense. I thought it said.

76
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.610
caitlin: alright. Now I'm gonna type food. Microsoft. Oh.

77
00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:11.979
caitlin: perfect! Again! Just step on the keyboard. I found the letter that I wanted by sliding my finger or touching it in various places, found the letter I wanted, and I lift my finger off the screen to enter that letter.

78
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:19.109
caitlin: Alright. Double tap

79
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.820
caitlin: 6.

80
00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.269
caitlin: I don't have some keyboard bye.

81
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:25.819
caitlin: We don't pay 0

82
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.210
caitlin: 0 0

83
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.649
caitlin: 500 bucks, but perfect. Thank you.

84
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:36.939
caitlin: Keep our tone budget, category info food box guide, our name teamwork.

85
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:42.270
caitlin: Okay? But it kind of went down. Edbox. Cut my name. Pause, please.

86
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.980
caitlin: Apologies for the pause. Just had to change something in my android settings.

87
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:59.069
caitlin: Let's continue characters. Your text button. Okay? So 500 has been set like the maximum amount of money you've been spending this category.

88
00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:02.129
caitlin: which was the maximum amount of money you could spend this category.

89
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:10.630
caitlin: add income button. Now, I don't know if I'm supposed to add income from here or add more categories. Info. Hmm.

90
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.600
because that definitely says, add income, not at at category.

91
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:27.170
caitlin: But this is budget category. I kinda wonder if this button is mislabeled. So let's double tap on, add income and see what happens? This says, add income for sure.

92
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:36.200
caitlin: I wonder if it's supposed to say, add category. Let's table tap money manager. open navigation for one. Okay. Money manager, open navigation door

93
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:43.609
caitlin: category name, budget list.

94
00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:50.169
caitlin: Food. Okay? Perfect. Alright 100. It's good. I got $500 and less.

95
00:08:50.860 --> 00:09:11.159
caitlin:  yeah. So one thing I want to mention here. This is $500. If there's anything on the screen letting a cited person know that that's the maximum amount you can spend in that category. It'd be helpful to know that as a screener user, if that information does not display it, then looks good. So let's add another category

96
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.490
caitlin: double tap.

97
00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:19.689
caitlin: So you may have heard it says detected icon add but it before it says.

98
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:23.679
caitlin: but actually it doesn't say on label button anymore. That's interesting. It's

99
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:44.189
caitlin: but it says, detected. And that means talkback is trying its best to detect what that buttons label is. But that's definitely not reliable. Unfortunately, because oftentimes it just says, you know, detected Icon, and it doesn't. You know, it isn't able to actually read what that button is. But it would be really helpful to have an official label for that button, so let's double tap.

100
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.809
caitlin: but a category info category. Name Ed fox.

101
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:50.539
caitlin: category name 110. But you ask questions, expand toolbar.

102
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:54.149
caitlin: Let's see, I have a dog. So I'm gonna do dog.

103
00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:56.170
caitlin: Oh.

104
00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:05.850
caitlin: budget like a maximum amount of money characters enter 3 50. Make the next. write the mail budget, write the maximum characters, enter 3 50

105
00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:09.920
caitlin: budget break, and that's the amount of money you can spend in this kind of box

106
00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.750
caitlin: windows on keyboard, too. 0,

107
00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:17.749
caitlin: 0 8, 5

108
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:19.590
caitlin: 0.

109
00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:22.510
caitlin: 0.

110
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:25.890
caitlin: Not sure. Why, talkbys having trouble entering things in today?

111
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.350
caitlin: Or maybe it's me.

112
00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.850
caitlin: I think 250 got a box budget. Alright, perfect. Alright your text button

113
00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:33.070
caitlin: your next one.

114
00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:41.450
caitlin: I didn't like that.

115
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.520
caitlin: And this add income button. It'd be helpful. If it said.

116
00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.159
caitlin: add category, button, double tap.

117
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:48.440
caitlin: Keep working

118
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:54.369
caitlin: money, manager, detective icon, add button annotation, button windows, share audio, get it detected alright. We'll do one more

119
00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:58.469
caitlin: budget category info. Good morning. Anybody you ask corn, Shawn.

120
00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:05.120
caitlin: I'm actually gonna use my external keyboard for this. because dealing with the on screen keyboard is.

121
00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:09.560
caitlin: as you saw, a little creepy turning on external keyword.

122
00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:15.880
caitlin: Okay.

123
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:39.070
caitlin: perfect. And the handy thing about that is when I type on my external keyboard. I can actually remain my screen. Your focus remains on the edit field itself rather than going in the edit field. And and I have to, you know, actually touch the middle of the screen and find find the edit field so I can continue swiping. So

124
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:44.679
caitlin: keep more chilling. Expand to warm. Alright, let's do. I don't know

125
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.190
caitlin: me, too.

126
00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.430
caitlin: Stop, share one window, zoom 0 8 0

127
00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:51.780
caitlin: 0 0

128
00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.700
caitlin: heading. Do you want to get a box budget? Okay? So to the right. Your text button?

129
00:11:55.750 --> 00:12:00.060
caitlin: Right? And that's not amount of money, anything. But keep your hand. I got her.

130
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:02.859
caitlin: Okay. My next task is to

131
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:10.359
caitlin: add an income. Okay, I've I've already seen that. So in order to go. But it's more options. But it's under more options still that

132
00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:23.389
caitlin: okay, in this section. It would be really helpful to have these labeled as buttons that are links. Just so I can know that I can confidently, confidently know that I can interact with these

133
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:33.339
caitlin: as it as it sits currently, they just kind of look like little bits of text. So I hope that I can interact with them. Okay, add income. Know that

134
00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:34.619
caitlin: adding fun. One more question.

135
00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:38.660
caitlin: Okay, money amount, double tap.

136
00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:40.960
caitlin: Keep more tone. 9, 6,

137
00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:45.079
caitlin: 6, 3. That's face free. 6

138
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:55.170
caitlin: for that 0. Come on not too far. Stop share button, you know. Zoom 0 at 9 0

139
00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:02.489
caitlin: 0 0, 0. Okay, touch heading 3,000 in a box. Let me help me know about your wallet.

140
00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:05.889
caitlin: Windows sound keyboard. That's weird, Andrew. More 0,

141
00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:11.020
caitlin: I think 3,000 bucks. Let me know we know what? You're willing. Okay, we'll do that. Separate your text button.

142
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:34.189
caitlin: Okay, how do I add? Add, okay, add income. That one is labeled properly. I find it interesting that on this screen the add income button is you have to swipe back to the left, but on the other screen for both, adding expenses and adding categories. The add Button is swipable to the right.

143
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:37.710
caitlin: That's a little a little confusing double-tap

144
00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:45.389
caitlin: your wallet contains. Now 3,000 editor. Keep working editor. I like that. I read that little alert says your wallet now contains 30,000.

145
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:52.099
caitlin: That's very useful to know. Okay, what do I do next? Let's see. add some expenses, transactions.

146
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:54.360
caitlin: category. Name more options, budget categories.

147
00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:59.249
caitlin: Okay, open navigation drawer, one open navigation drawer menu money manager. One expenses

148
00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:02.560
caitlin: once expenses. Double tap. Yeah, one's expenses.

149
00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:18.250
caitlin: It'd be helpful to know that this is a checkable. I think these are radio buttons. but I'm not sure because it's not saying $0, $250. So it would be super helpful to know that that is

150
00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:26.000
caitlin: on on that section. When you're changing to from category to expenses, expenses to category that those are

151
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:31.620
caitlin: radio buttons, 0% like thought. 0 0% food. Alright.

152
00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:38.170
caitlin: you're expensive. This one food and list 0% slayer. no 0% $0 to one transportation 0% select

153
00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:50.190
caitlin: $0. Do you want? Okay, just looking at the screen? So far, it's got 0, both a slider and $0 spent total expenses, total expenses and and expense perfect total tap.

154
00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:52.090
caitlin: So a new transaction

155
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:57.589
caitlin: product category, you got it back on down product category and part of category. I can't knock down Mr. Food.

156
00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:09.180
caitlin: This is detected icon list. I don't know if this is labeled or not because it does say food, which is a label that I gave the category that we'd like to add in food. So let's do that

157
00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.719
caitlin: enter info. Does that mean? Like

158
00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:16.779
caitlin: the amount? Character center 0 10. Enter info. Get a box, enter info transaction 8.

159
00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:31.489
caitlin: So there's 2 enter info boxes here. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to type in both. One has a character count, so I assume that's letters, and one, I assume, would ring up numbers, but it'd be helpful to have more descriptive labels.

160
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:35.879
caitlin: Forget about it.

161
00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.339
caitlin: I'm gonna grab my external keyword again.

162
00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:43.389
caitlin: Thank you for your patience.

163
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:44.620
Any for that.

164
00:15:48.770 --> 00:16:08.069
caitlin: Okay, we have a local place called Kruger. So that's just what I typed in for the place, you know, that would typically shop. Yep, okay, so just before that. So I have punctuation turned off

165
00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:10.529
caitlin: But just before that

166
00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:19.539
caitlin: turned off by meaning my screener doesn't read like commas periods. It just uses intonation to let me know those things are there.

167
00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:23.449
caitlin: So if it said dollar sign

168
00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:40.580
caitlin: I, of course, didn't hear it. But interestingly, when I double tapped on that. It did say Dollar sign briefly, I don't know why. I don't know if that's because that was automatically put in the edit field, or if that was the label it was reading. I assume that was input into the edit field. But

169
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.249
caitlin: don't know if I can verify that

170
00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:43.100
no time.

171
00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.430
caitlin: Oh. interesting.

172
00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:50.120
caitlin: interesting director 6 of 10 and kind of like ibuprofen.

173
00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:55.299
caitlin: Give me just a second. I'll explain what I'm doing in a moment.

174
00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:56.970
That's all.

175
00:16:57.930 --> 00:16:58.620
caitlin: Okay.

176
00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:01.590
caitlin: no time getting a 25 bucks. No time.

177
00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:06.869
caitlin: The dollar sign is actually after the edit box, which is interesting.

178
00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.079
Okay, okay, boss.

179
00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:18.469
caitlin: And it's just labeled, okay, it's just labeled, Enter Info. Okay? It'd be helpful to say, like, I don't know. Money spent.

180
00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:22.740
caitlin: Something more descriptive than inter info

181
00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:27.669
caitlin: to expel confusion. So we will say. I don't know. 150.

182
00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:30.720
caitlin: No time.

183
00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.519
caitlin: I think. 150. Okay.

184
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:38.349
caitlin: alright. Let's separate your text. Button, transaction date.

185
00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:42.490
caitlin: transaction date 2024, 2024. That's fine. January 20, seventh.

186
00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:48.499
caitlin: twenty-seventh. That's fine. 2024,

187
00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:55.490
caitlin: February second, 2024. Let's actually make sure we can change a date. We'll say we spent it on February second, Friday, February second, 2024 selected

188
00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.440
caitlin: Yay, it says, selected. That's so helpful.

189
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:14.670
caitlin: February third, February fourth, Alright selected. February select, February February 9, 2024, February sixteenth, 2020, fourth February fourteenth, February tenth 2024, Ends, up, your text button characters, 6, 10 characters, 6 of 10. Product category.

190
00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.630
caitlin: Touch it back, calm down, knock down list, food program, box, enterprise, editing, 150, transaction day, free. February second.

191
00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:23.819
caitlin: February 1520240, I don't actually know how to move along.

192
00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.560
caitlin: Okay, I guess we have to suck through the whole calendar. February 1620. Yep.

193
00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:36.160
caitlin: Transition. Okay.

194
00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:55.019
caitlin: So it was a little tedious for the screener to to need to swipe through the entire calendar to get to the add transaction. Button one way could be to have the transaction add transaction button, maybe also at the top, which I realize is, you know, changing things pretty significantly.

195
00:18:55.030 --> 00:19:07.589
caitlin: or maybe once the date has been selected, maybe the calendar should close. I think that might be a little bit easier. I don't know how doable either of those are. But those are my suggestions. Just to go swiping the through the entire calendar.

196
00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:13.750
caitlin: Actually want to try something. Okay, put myself back on the calendar.

197
00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:17.059
caitlin: I'm going to navigate. But with 3 fingers swept down and also

198
00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:29.479
caitlin: okay and navigate it to something called controls. Now, if I press, or if I swipe down, I can navigate navigate to the next control, which should be that button. So let's try. February 1620, 24.

199
00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:31.960
caitlin: So February seventeenth, 2024.

200
00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:46.100
caitlin: Oh, okay, those are also seen as controls. Okay? Oh, one thing I wanted to mention. These aren't labeled as buttons or links. So it'd be helpful, or check boxes, or whatever they might be. It would be helpful to know which element this is.

201
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:48.749
caitlin: So. Okay, I gotta talk through the whole thing.

202
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:56.589
caitlin: February 26. Today. February 20, eighth February 2920 transaction button. Okay, add transaction. Button.

203
00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:00.180
caitlin: Second, option concession, but 53 equals one production equals program

204
00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:12.750
caitlin: 1 6 open navigation door, but expenses more options, fun category. Name your expenses this month 30. So according to this, I've spent 30 in my

205
00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:27.130
caitlin: food category, $500, $150 out of 500 $0. Annotation. That expense. One window. My manager. Okay. Add expense.

206
00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:32.029
caitlin: happy transaction! I come down, enter, forget it. I come down rocket.

207
00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:33.960
caitlin: pop, window, moving list.

208
00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:38.099
caitlin: Say, we spend something for the dog, that new transaction

209
00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:46.670
caitlin: enter and forget a box detected by calm down. Write down, let's go out. Enter and forget anybody. You ask Cori Shawn on that life my phone down so I can type.

210
00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:56.650
caitlin: I think having dog food next to food might be a little confusing. But since already okay, I go name dog and food.

211
00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.570
caitlin: I always call her

212
00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:08.269
caitlin: meal, no matter what time it is dinner. So we will put dinner.

213
00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:15.210
caitlin: your text button.

214
00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:19.560
caitlin: and we will say 100,

215
00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.799
caitlin: editing, 100 bucks entrance. Oh, okay.

216
00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:31.390
caitlin: dollar sign clear text, but transaction date 2,024 to February 27 previous month, button next month, button, February the first 2,024 next month, button previous month, Button.

217
00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.109

caitlin: February 29. Transaction transaction

221
00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:51.659
caitlin: connection. But if you're equals 2 but nothing equals there.

222
00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:58.550
caitlin: I assume it's not supposed to read that. It says like product, and some jumbled up letters and product

223
00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:07.260
caitlin: or something equals. I assume it's just supposed to say like. I don't know the expense added, or something like that, that'd be a little more useful.

224
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:12.239
caitlin: I don't even know if I screen you're supposed to read that part. Total expenses.

225
00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:24.309
caitlin: $0, 200 fine. Interesting. That total expenses doesn't have anything next to it. Yet 0 transportation. Okay.

226
00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:28.460
caitlin: pop up window, not transportation transportation, add new transaction.

caitlin: total expenses unless total expenses. It doesn't actually say anything. Do I have to double tap?

247
00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:04.439
caitlin: Okay, I double tap 3 times. Nothing happened. My screener is not able to read how many of what the total expenses are.

248
00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:12.450
caitlin: Okay. Edit one edit. One of your budget categories to change the name and save it.

00:24:54.870 --> 00:25:01.089
caitlin: says you cannot change the name money manager. I don't know what that means.

259
00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.440
caitlin: but then it says editing. So we'll try, anyway.

260
00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.440
caitlin: Okay?

261
00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:17.919
caitlin: Oh, it inserted me before

caitlin: or in.

263
00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:36.789
caitlin: Alright I navigated with 3 fingers, swipe down until I hear the word word, and then I swipe down with a single finger to get behind the word dog.

264
00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:38.689
caitlin: That's me that's on me.

266
00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:52.430
caitlin: can't get into the add income. It's so confusing.

267
00:25:52.660 --> 00:26:01.070
caitlin: I didn't come. Money, manager, food and list. Alright. Let's swipe 500 dog stuff, 250 dog stuff. Okay, that worked alright. What am I supposed to do next

268
00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:05.040

269
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:09.220

270
00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:11.679
caitlin: Well, let's find out

271
00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:16.950

278
00:26:51.830 --> 00:27:09.289
caitlin: It's a little confusing, so it says, your wallet contains enough money for this. Your wallet contains enough money for this plan, and that's up to the right. Your wallet contains enough money for this plan. Your wallet contains enough money for this plan. Swip right. The deadline of this plan has passed. The deadline of this plan has passed. Swipe right. The deadline of this plan has passed. The deadline of this plan has passed. I don't know why it reads it twice.

279
00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:21.939
caitlin: and I don't know if these are buttons links, just bits of text. I'm not sure what this is. I kind of button. Okay? Detected icon. Add button again. This is another unlabel button. So if that could be labeled as add, that'd be super helpful double tap

280
00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:24.300
caitlin: plan info plan. I open a box

281
00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:29.120
caitlin: plan, title. I don't know. I would call that

282
00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:33.679
caitlin: Hmm! We'll say march.

283
00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:40.960
caitlin: boxline title, perfect separate

284
00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:44.779
caitlin: characters. Enter 5 to 50, plan, description, edit, box, plan, description.

285
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:50.000
caitlin: I don't know. Characters enter 0 50

286
00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:58.740
caitlin: characters entered land description in a box. Characters entered 0 50 lans budget edit box plans. Budget dollar, sign keeper telling.

287
00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:04.449
caitlin: Oh. we'll say 800

288
00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:10.570
caitlin: getting the 100 bucks. My budget.

289
00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:14.699
caitlin: Your text button planned deadline date plan, deadline date 2024,

290
00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:18.929
caitlin: June, February 20, seventh. Bring this month, button next month, button next month, button

291
00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:21.999
caitlin: previous month to February 20 seventh.

292
00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:25.660
caitlin: 1B s. What? What? What? What? What? What?

293
00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:27.539
March 1320, 24,

294
00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:31.130
caitlin: march march fifteenth, 2020, march fifteenth, Friday, March fifteenth, 2020.

295
00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:38.570
caitlin: Geranyo annotation fun.

296
00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:44.769
caitlin: There we go. Okay, again. It'd be helpful to have that add add plan, button.

297
00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:52.950
caitlin: either at the top of the screen, so I could just easily not have to easily get up there and tap it, or and not have to slip through the category or

298
00:28:52.990 --> 00:29:03.610
caitlin: calendar either call sounding word, and and or once a date has been selected. If the calendar itself would collapse, that would be super super helpful. That will have.

299
00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:07.110
caitlin: You're planning successfully. Money manager money manager

300
00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:08.250
caitlin: detected like on that button.

301
00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:14.350
caitlin: Okay, I've done that. Lastly, check out the 2 analysis results.

302
00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:22.019
caitlin: Okay. I wonder if that's on the screen? Your wallet contains enough money, more options, fun

303
00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:31.909
caitlin: your wallet, your wallet contains enough money for this plan. Okay, your wallet contains enough money for this plan. It's still repeated twice the deadline. If this plan has passed and this plan has passed. That is not true, because it lies next month.

304
00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:37.420
caitlin: The deadline of this plan has passed again. That repeat repeats twice, march from March fifteenth. $2,400 a list.

305
00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:49.539
caitlin: I'm not sure what the instruction mean by lastly, check out the 2 analysis results. So let's look on the dropdown. I mean the menu. Just a little bit plans

306
00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:53.910
caitlin: real quick

307
00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:59.149
caitlin: annotation by now. So deadline your wallet. More options, budget plans.

308
00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:07.479
caitlin: Okay. Navigation for one double-tap. Oh, that's okay.

309
00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:21.049
caitlin: Alright. That was a little unclear in the in the instructions. I wasn't sure what it meant. Analysis. Okay, budget analysis and monthly expenses, analogy, analysis. Look at budget budget analysis, double tap.

310
00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:22.770
caitlin: What analysis?

311
00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:30.260
caitlin: Interesting that that didn't say checked every time I tapped on something from this little screen, it says checked.

312
00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:41.310
caitlin: So I wonder if that's just like a butter link? It would be really, really helpful to have that information separate's fun. have you? What view I try and find your expenses for category. This one, with 3 points

313
00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:43.360
caitlin: and value is 30 maps. Value is 150 particle.

314
00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:47.480
caitlin: It's cool pie chart and then describes it.

315
00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:57.990
caitlin: Travel version, transportation, transportation, food, transportation, transportation.

316
00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:01.770
caitlin: They are annotation on windows. Zoom is an R.

317
00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:10.040
caitlin: Yeah. This this is not particularly accessible to a screen, reader, I thought it was going to be, but I don't know what it means.

318
00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:20.550
caitlin: So pie chart makes sense pie chart entitled. And then it kind of describes it. There has the minimum

319
00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:24.660
caitlin: minimum expenses for category this month with 3 points.

320
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:50.919
caitlin: Yeah, value is 30. Max value is 150. That's perfect. It tells me that it has 3 data points that's really good to know. But then the confusion starts with, what does this all mean trial version. I assume that's just something that they're using that money managers using to maybe like, make the chart. That's okay. Transportation dog stuff, food, food.

321
00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:52.820
kind of makes sense.

322
00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:55.509
caitlin: I try and title your text. Oops. Sorry.

323
00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:24.319
caitlin: That's a little confusing. Alright. Let's go to the other analysis. Open navigation drawer. Double tap. Can you let me manager? And again, just to get to that, I just touch on the screen where I thought it would be, and then

324
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:37.110
caitlin: move from there. Check budget analysis on the expense analysis. Oh, it's actually checked weird. Usually, it says, checked. But it didn't say check this time after I double tapped it checked on the expense. Okay? Monthly expenses. Analysis, still without

325
00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:43.530
caitlin: check, this time. Interesting. Didn't say last time.

326
00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:52.969
caitlin: I really appreciate that when I double tap on the little check, I assume is a radio button. I want to check box check.

327
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.309
caitlin: I assume that when I check it

328
00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:01.159
caitlin: not assume I'm so sorry my words are tangled with this morning. Let's try that again.

329
00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:15.129
caitlin: I really appreciate that when you check one of the Rio buttons in on that particular screen that it automatically takes you to the new. I don't know. Section new screen and you don't have to like, navigate your way out of that menu. That's just an extra added step that would be

330
00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:23.690
caitlin: not helpful. So I really appreciate that it automatically. Once you check something, it automatically takes you to the new screen

331
00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:40.059
caitlin: window manager. More options, one says by view, which is just something random that dropbox says, I guess, to let you know that there's web content. I'm not sure that's nothing to do with the app. I see that all over the place, and there it doesn't, is not able to read anything on this page. Unfortunately.

332
00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:43.119
caitlin: Is there anything else in the instructions?

333
00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:49.209
caitlin: Okay, so I've completely tasked to the best of my ability. I guess else.

334
00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:55.289
caitlin: Unfortunately, this was

335
00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:00.060
caitlin: sorry. Talk back is chattering.

336
00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:07.270
caitlin: Unfortunately, there's some things that need to be worked on. There's a couple only buttons.

337
00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:17.930
caitlin: There are a bunch of screens with elements that aren't identified as their particular element type, such as buttons, potentially links, radio buttons.

338
00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:23.270
caitlin: There is an edit field on the

339
00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:25.540
caitlin: when you're adding an expense

340
00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.449
caitlin: that is just

341
00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:41.099
caitlin: labeled in info, or something like that, and and don't know the particular label off top my head, but it'd be helpful if it was labeled I don't know. Add

342
00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:46.380
caitlin: money, expense, or something like that just something more helpful than info button.

343
00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:57.480
caitlin:  the when you're making a category, the add category button isn't slippled, as I think it says. Add expense, or add income or something like that.

344
00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:02.579
caitlin: Those are the major things I can think of. Off the top of my head

345
00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:08.470
caitlin: that you'd need a little bit of work on in order for it to be fully usable by screen reader users.

346
00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:11.130
caitlin: Oh, and the the radio buttons.

347
00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:16.020
caitlin: I think I mentioned that couple times. I assume they're radio buttons

348
00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:18.810
caitlin: trying to think if there's anything else.

349
00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:28.730
caitlin: I don't think so. So I think if those things were improved that this would be really, really oh, sorry.

350
00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:31.120
caitlin: The the chart

351
00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:35.890
caitlin: both of the analysis screens are confusing

352
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:38.160
caitlin: the

353
00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:45.490
caitlin: monthly expenses. I think it is like I don't know. I don't know. It doesn't say the screen I'm currently on is completely inaccessible.

354
00:35:45.620 --> 00:36:00.220
caitlin: and the other one with the pie chart was sort of accessible, but it was confusing, because it said, one of the categories. I can't remember what it was. I think it was transportation. It said 0 to 0, which doesn't make any sense to me.

355
00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:06.540
caitlin:  yes, so I think if these things were fixed, it would it would be

356
00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.100
caitlin: close to

357
00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:18.610
caitlin: fully accessible. Of course I can't speak for the other sections that I haven't explored, but I think if these things were were fixed it would be go a long way to making it

358
00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:21.300
caitlin: an accessible app for the blind. So

359
00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:27.460
caitlin: thank you very much for your continued commitment to accessibility. Thank you for allowing me to find my thoughts and be back. And thanks, Wilson.
