00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:12.260
Phoenix: Hi. My name is Phoenix, and I'm a tester for fable. Today we are going to be working on Sgt. Tracking your expenses with money manager 3

2
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.340
Phoenix: UOC. I'd dash RCLL. 1 0.

3
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:29.959
Phoenix: So today we are just going to be looking at a money manager. App. It is a budgeting tool. So we'll be going through and setting up a couple of expense categories and adding an income

4
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.870
Phoenix: and looking at a few different areas to kind of get a sense of

5
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.989
Phoenix: an overall budget. You know, how much is everything actually costing us?

6
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.740
Phoenix: We're just going to take an overall look at this app and

7
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.330
Phoenix: you know, check out a few different things and talk about

8
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:57.029
Phoenix: how accessible it is. What could be improved, what's done? Well, and with that being said, we're going to go ahead and get started. I am on the homepage of the money manager. App

9
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:10.260
Phoenix: and I'm at the top of the screen. And the so the first thing that we're gonna do is kind of explore the app and get a feel for it after we've gotten a feel for it. Then I will go in and create some expense categories.

10
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.069
Phoenix: So I'm just going to start by swiping to the right.

11
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.019
Phoenix: Okay. apologies. I just needed to make sure I was at the top.

12
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.970
Awesome.

13
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.970
Phoenix: Okay? Excellent. I don't know.

14
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:30.960
Phoenix: But I guess I'm fine. No matter. Okay, and that annotation is just zoom controls at the bottom, so it has nothing to do with the app.

15
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.430
Phoenix: So

16
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.190
Phoenix: since I want to create some expense categories, let me let me check and see

17
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.040
awesome.

18
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.900
Phoenix: Okay? So maybe I'll try double tapping where it says category name

19
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.909
Phoenix: at this point at this point. and that didn't really seem to do anything

20
00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.779
Phoenix: and morning. Watch this.

21
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.840
Oh, my telephone.

22
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:08.229
Phoenix: Let's see. Maybe I need to check out this main menu and see if creating a category is in this. So let's double tap on the

23
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:17.659
Phoenix: open menu and and yeah, I'm sorry. Okay, I'll just. I'm sorry. Alright, let's try double tapping on budget categories.

24
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.250
Phoenix: Okay, not fun. Okay, not just fine morning.

25
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.830
Awesome.

26
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.060
Phoenix: I mean, okay.

27
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:38.000
Phoenix: So this unlabeled button I'm going to guess is an Add button for a category. Let me go ahead and try double tapping on that, and just see if it is

28
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.479
Phoenix: okay. Okay. So

29
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:55.110
Phoenix: the first thing to note is that it would be really, really important to add some text to that unlabeled button that says, add category. Just so, you know, people are aware of what this button does.

30
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.799
Phoenix: But with that being said, let's go ahead and type in a category name.

31
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.760
Phoenix: That's great.

32
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.169
Phoenix: We will do food.

33
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.330
Phoenix: Take that up.

34
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.110
Phoenix: It is

35
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.040
Phoenix: morning awesome. Oh, it didn't type my characters.

36
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.160
Phoenix: Sorry. Let me try that again.

37
00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.620
you know. Okay, okay.

38
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:42.060
Phoenix: that was 100% user error. It had nothing to do with the the app. I forgot that I'm supposed to double tap instead of tap and hold on this keyboard to type in my characters. So let's keep exploring this window.

39
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.770
Phoenix: It is to be my husband. I'm late at this point.

40
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.580
Phoenix: We're not gonna leave it until we can.

41
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.699
Phoenix: Okay, we're going to give ourselves a budget of, let's say, 500

42
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.180
Phoenix: 24 pulled up by

43
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.290
Phoenix: okay.

44
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:21.820
Phoenix: continue exploring the screen. I guess I need to add my income will try double tapping on this button and see what it does.

45
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.130
Phoenix: Okay.

46
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.260
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

47
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:38.800
Phoenix: Okay, so I think that label might have been a little bit misleading because it says, add income, but when you double tap on it, it appears to just

48
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:51.410
Phoenix: save your category. So perhaps renaming the label to save instead of add income. But we will go ahead and create a second category. Now.

49
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.390
Phoenix: I'm sorry.

50
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.039
Phoenix: All right, we will call this one.

51
00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.939
Phoenix: That's great bills deep like pulling up.

52
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.300
Yup.

53
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.820
Okay.

54
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.090
Phoenix: yes, dear.

55
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.720
Phoenix: I don't like.

56
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.130
Phoenix: I don't. But wait a minute.

57
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:24.829
Phoenix: Okay, then we're gonna write the maximum amount we can spend in this category. We're gonna assume that we've got pretty high bills. So let's do $1,500

58
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.960
Phoenix: number 4.

59
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.669
Phoenix: Maybe I can find the one.

60
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.759
Phoenix: Let me double check and make sure. I wrote that number right?

61
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.490
Phoenix: Test one. I guess I got them.

62
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.630
Phoenix: So we'll double tap on this. Add income button again.

63
00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.240
Phoenix: Okay, so that's

64
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:56.569
Phoenix: morning.

65
00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:58.640
Phoenix: bye, bye.

66
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:04.669
Phoenix: Okay? So there are the categories that we've added. We're just gonna add to for the sake of this demonstration.

67
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:11.120
Phoenix: So now we need to add a few expenses.

68
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:19.290
Phoenix: So let's go ahead and try to double tap on one of these categories and see if that's how you add an expense.

69
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.470
Phoenix: I don't know. I'm not

70
00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:29.160
Phoenix: specific. But okay. So let's say, we went to the store and we spent

71
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.460
Phoenix: $150.

72
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.270
Phoenix: I'm just one with jocke.

73
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.840
Phoenix: with the specific

74
00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:40.939
Phoenix: resistance. This position?

75
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:43.080
Phoenix: Well.

76
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.079
Phoenix: I'm not seeing how to add an expense here. So let's go back to

77
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:55.410
Phoenix: the screen we were on before this I had a final argument. Okay, let's try going back to the main menu. I just don't, really.

78
00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.370
Phoenix: That's fine. Sorry schedule one.

79
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.169
Yeah, I'm sorry I'm not.

80
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:08.539
Phoenix: I'll even know this. and that's been better. Let's try going back up to the top.

81
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.960
Phoenix: It didn't go back up to the top like I wanted it to. Let's doublet up on months expenses.

82
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:18.720
Phoenix: Okay? Awesome

83
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.590
Phoenix: for me.

84
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.320
Phoenix: Okay, sorry.

85
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.279
Phoenix: Okay. Now, we're going to try to double tap on this food category. Okay.

86
00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:33.890
Phoenix: Yup.

87
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:42.599
Phoenix: that doesn't appear to have brought anything up. Let's try clicking on a different part of this category.

88
00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.089
Phoenix: You're like, sorry. This is my fault.

89
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.940
Phoenix: You'll get your responsibility specific budget

90
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.100
Phoenix: which are fun journal, Mr. Funnell.

91
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.700
Phoenix: But pause

92
00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:04.860
Phoenix: apologies for the pause. I needed to get some brief clarifications on the task instructions.

93
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:11.450
Phoenix: So we're just going to go ahead and continue with where we left off. Trying to add some expenses.

94
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:15.909
Phoenix: So I'm going to continue to explore this screen.

95
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:21.070
Phoenix: So you've got

96
00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:23.819
Phoenix: your expenses this month's expenses and food.

97
00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:34.070
Phoenix: and I feel like this would be where I would add my expenses. But I'm not noticing a place to add them. So let me maybe try double tapping on

98
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.700
Phoenix: some of these options, maybe where it says food

99
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.269
Phoenix: that didn't do anything.

100
00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.129
Phoenix: We'll try your expenses.

101
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:55.760
Phoenix: Okay. So we've tried double tapping on all the options, and it hasn't done anything. So let's go back. I know it was.

102
00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.320
Phoenix: You're not. You're done bye.

103
00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:05.920
Phoenix: Maybe I need. I don't know if I I'll try adjusting the slider and see what that does.

104
00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.140
Phoenix: You're locked in. Tense, sir.

105
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:11.330
Bye? Bye.

106
00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:14.420
Phoenix: no, no, sorry.

107
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:26.250
Phoenix: so I can see that there's a slider, and it's changing. But I have absolutely no idea what it does, because it it doesn't say what it does. It just says. 5%, 10%.

108
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:37.810
Phoenix: But I'm not quite sure what's happening. So I'm gonna go ahead and explore a little bit more and see if we can find a different way to add some expenses.

109
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:39.830
Phoenix: Morning, we're just fine.

110
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.499
Phoenix: Let's see what's in more options.

111
00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:44.090
Bye-bye.

112
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:45.790
Phoenix: I don't feel like.

113
00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:51.980
Phoenix: So those aren't what we need yet. Let's go back.

114
00:09:52.990 --> 00:10:00.619
Phoenix: We'll try going back to the main menu, and let's just look at all the options that are present in the menu.

115
00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:03.079
Phoenix: One of the

116
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:11.680
Phoenix: let's see what happens if we

117
00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:16.789
Phoenix: double tap on budget plans. Okay? No problem.

118
00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.790
Phoenix: Just 1%. I'm looking at like that.

119
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:29.430
Phoenix: Okay, so I don't. That doesn't appear to be where we can add expenses, either. Let's go back to the main menu.

120
00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:30.500
Phoenix: Okay, okay.

121
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.090
Phoenix: bye, bye.

122
00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:34.230
it's beneficial.

123
00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.620
Phoenix: Okay, that's it.

124
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:46.900
Phoenix: I mean, that's another. Let's see. we've looked around a little bit in months expenses. Let's try one more thing. Okay? Awesome

125
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.669
Phoenix: morning. This one.

126
00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:56.119
Phoenix: Okay, let's try double tapping on food and see if it brings up a list of options.

127
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:09.119
Phoenix: I am not noticing any options. Let me continue to explore the screen a little bit to see if maybe there's anything I miss.

128
00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:12.440
Phoenix: Okay, sorry. Do you worry your first time?

129
00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:15.780
Phoenix: One but

130
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.830
specific.

131
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.030
Phoenix: Okay. you're just

132
00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:29.699
Phoenix: so I tried clicking on the the dollar amount. Double tapping. I apologize. And it it still brought me back to this screen where I can't enter anything. So let's go back.

133
00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:31.070
Okay, no. Worries

134
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:33.860
Phoenix: continue to explore the screen.

135
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:41.960
Phoenix: Well, there's an ad expense button. Let's try this one.

136
00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.030
Awesome.

137
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:52.659
Phoenix: Okay, that is much more self-explanatory. I was thinking you had to

138
00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.709
Phoenix: get to a category first, and then you could add your expenses.

139
00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:07.560
Phoenix: So and I really don't think that that's an accessibility issue. I just think that you know, a user guide would be helpful just to say.

140
00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.380
Phoenix: when you're on your list of categories. There's a

141
00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:21.930
Phoenix: add button at the bottom that will take you to where you had your expenses. And honestly, some of this was my fault. I should have explored the screen a little further, but I didn't. I just assumed it would be in the

142
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:27.720
Phoenix: I would double tap on a category, and that's how you would add it. So let's go ahead and try to add an expense here.

143
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:30.820
Phoenix: We know we want the

144
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:35.920
Phoenix: food category. So let's explore this whole screen before I make any decisions

145
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.519
Phoenix: enter the loss enterprise.

146
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.839
Phoenix: We're not fine.

147
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.100
Phoenix: Senator. Under the

148
00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:52.909
Phoenix: apologies I had to sneeze. so we appear to be in some sort of calendar.

149
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:54.960
Phoenix: everything awesome.

150
00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:58.340
Phoenix: so

151
00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:04.319
Phoenix: navigating to the bottom of the screen, and see if that takes us past this calendar.

152
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:05.609
Phoenix: 100 people working

153
00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:11.579
Phoenix: well, jingo, all the way to the bottom, but it did scroll significantly down the calendar. So let's continue to explore.

154
00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:28.219
Phoenix: Let me go back to the top and let's have a little look now that we've explored the whole screen.

155
00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:29.970
Phoenix: everything 33, 10.

156
00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:38.490
Phoenix: And so there are 2. Apologize. There are 2 boxes that say, enter info this first one. It did eventually say

157
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:46.149
Phoenix: that it was the food category. So let's go to the right and see if this one has a description with it as well

158
00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:54.530
Phoenix: does not so let's double tap on it, and just see what it brings up, because I can see that there are 10 characters allowed in it

159
00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:58.220
so much. Thank you.

160
00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:15.779
Phoenix: but I do not know what I'm supposed to put here. I don't know if it's supposed to be a description of what I purchased, or if it's where you put the amount of money that you spent, let me explore a little bit more to see if there's a separate category for the money. You spent

161
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:18.170
Phoenix: everything possible. Okay, awesome.

162
00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:27.109
Phoenix: So all of these boxes are unlabeled.

163
00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:39.189
Phoenix:  so that means that as a screen reader user. I do not know what is supposed to go in them. I can make my best guess, and we can see if that is or is not correct.

164
00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:44.610
and we'll just try that since the first one takes 10 characters.

165
00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:46.540
Phoenix: I'll just assume

166
00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:57.580
Phoenix: that I'll put in a vague description of what was in here. So let's say we went to Walmart. I'll write Walmart in this box

167
00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:00.200
Phoenix: today. Thank you absolutely.

168
00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.620
Phoenix: Delete. L.

169
00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:03.599
Thank you.

170
00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:11.810
Tiktok.

171
00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.689
Phoenix: Okay, let's look at the next box. But it wasn't

172
00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:18.200
Phoenix: okay. Awesome.

173
00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:29.969
Phoenix: Let's double tap on this and see what it does. Okay? So it looks like, this is where we're going to say how much we spent. So I said we would say, we spent 1 50.

174
00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:35.680
Phoenix: So let's do one 5.

175
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:37.700
Phoenix: See? You?

176
00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.150
Phoenix: Hospital. Okay?

177
00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:45.710
Phoenix: Now, let's pick a date.

178
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:47.350
Okay.

179
00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.429
Phoenix: don't work. Okay. But you said.

180
00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:50.660
be a month fine.

181
00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:58.439
Phoenix: Hold up, Gotcha Gotcha. We'll just say that we went there yesterday.

182
00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.310
Phoenix: Monday, February 26.

183
00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:06.030
Phoenix: Now let's see if there, I think there's an add transaction button.

184
00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:09.250
Phoenix: Hold up.

185
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:12.709
Phoenix: Thank you. Thank you.

186
00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:14.010
Your date on the work.

187
00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:18.329
Phoenix: There we go. There we go.

188
00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:20.149
Phoenix: double tap on add transaction.

189
00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:22.330
Phoenix: You want to be invited.

190
00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:35.190
Oh, I was supposed to add an income before I did this. so II only got confused on that, because when I added my categories, it said, add income, and for some reason

191
00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:38.010
Phoenix: my mind thought we already added an income.

192
00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:41.990
But I remember seeing add and come in more options. So let's look at that.

193
00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.600
Phoenix: We're just one way. We're just one

194
00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:47.430
Phoenix: like it was. Hang on.

195
00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.130
Phoenix: I just we don't. I don't. We don't like

196
00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:54.770
Phoenix: okay money amount? I don't.

197
00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:56.630
Okay.

198
00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:11.919
Phoenix: and I don't know if we're doing yearly or monthly. It would be helpful if it said, you know, annual income or monthly income. But I'm just for the sake of this exercise I'm going to assume it's monthly, so we'll say that we had a $6,000 income.

199
00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:19.470
Okay.

200
00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:21.890
Phoenix: okay.

201
00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:24.709
Phoenix: I just thought I got one

202
00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:30.460
Phoenix: double tap on add income.

203
00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:37.430
Phoenix: Now we will once again try to add the suspense.

204
00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:41.350
Okay, awesome. I wasn't.

205
00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:44.109
Phoenix: and it's already in food. Everything else.

206
00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:49.390
Phoenix: We went to.

207
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:54.070
Phoenix: Speaker. If you want to. tapped on the wrong thing, let me go back.

208
00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.070
Phoenix: Pause.

209
00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:27.960
Phoenix: apologies for the pause. II just had some technical difficulties I had to work out. So let's go ahead and type in this screen. The name of this, the place where we shop, at which I said was Walmart. So let's do.

210
00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.880
Phoenix: WA. Umhm

211
00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:35.200
Phoenix: Jenny Oopsi

212
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:38.000
Phoenix: on Mute.

213
00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:43.929
Phoenix: and I said we spent $150. So let's look for the next box.

214
00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:49.040
Phoenix: Representative. Everything possible, everything possible. 1 50.

215
00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:55.180
Alright.

216
00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:59.440
Phoenix: And I said, we shop there yesterday.

217
00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:03.509
Phoenix: Hold up 2 pump 2.

218
00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.010
I'm gonna do nothing work.

219
00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.500
Phoenix: and you're ready to stop my period.

220
00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.320
Phoenix: 100, you know 101

221
00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:23.959
Phoenix: double tap on add transaction. There we go, and II like the the little notification it gives when you have completed the transaction.

222
00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:30.539
When you've added the transaction, perhaps in the future I would be helpful to make it shorter, and just say transaction added.

223
00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:40.410
Phoenix: but for the sake of time. we're just going to add only one expense to this. and let's now we'll move on.

224
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:44.539
Phoenix: We're going to edit one of our categories.

225
00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:48.879
we'll just change the budget. So let's go

226
00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.750
Phoenix: back to the main menu.

227
00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:57.649
Phoenix: We'll double top on budget categories.

228
00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.259
Phoenix: 1 point we're just one morning, Buddy.

229
00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:01.840
Phoenix: Bye, bye.

230
00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.760
Phoenix: we'll change our food expense.

231
00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:10.560
Phoenix: Ouch, ouch!

232
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:19.679
Phoenix: Let's go back, cause I didn't do it. Like we'll double tap and hold. See if that brings it up.

233
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.330
Phoenix: But if it did not, let's try more options. Okay.

234
00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:26.230
Phoenix: just bye.

235
00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:30.080
Phoenix: Honest, with journal.

236
00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:31.610
Phoenix: the clock

237
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:35.000
Phoenix: morning. Let's see. Okay.

238
00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:42.040
Phoenix: okay, there we go

239
00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:45.280
Phoenix: at this point. Yes. But last, but

240
00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.769
we're gonna change this to

241
00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.090
Phoenix: $300.

242
00:20:52.550 --> 00:21:00.970
Phoenix: I don't know. And but we don't do

243
00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:02.820
done.

244
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:05.590
Phoenix: You know your test fun

245
00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.340
Phoenix: and add income

246
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:09.270
Phoenix: under the resource.

247
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:14.079
Phoenix: Okay, now, let's create a budget plan.

248
00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:16.879
Phoenix: Point 1 point.

249
00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.850
Phoenix: Let's look under budget plans and see if that's where it's at.

250
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:24.130
Phoenix: Okay?

251
00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:31.090
Phoenix: Ouch.

252
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:32.410
Phoenix: okay.

253
00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.299
Phoenix: I am not seeing the option. Let's look under more options, and that's brought us back.

254
00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:49.180
Phoenix: I apologize. It looks like the more options doesn't change from screen to screen. So we know to stop checking. There, let's go back.

255
00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.690
Phoenix: Joel. Welcome!

256
00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.400
Phoenix: Let's look at the main menu.

257
00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:03.009
Phoenix: I'm not. Just let me get another.

258
00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:05.389
Phoenix: I'm fine. I think I'll just

259
00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.980
Phoenix: check my hand.

260
00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:16.329
Phoenix: Just continue to explore this a little bit more

261
00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:20.090
Phoenix: you won't have.

262
00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:24.080
Phoenix: You're walking. You're walking up. you wanna give me a long time one time.

263
00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:26.409
Phoenix: Bye. Bye.

264
00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:30.190
Phoenix: Ouch! Ouch!

265
00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:44.270
Okay, there we go. So the create a plan. Button is unlabeled. And unfortunately it was right next to my zoom controls. So I thought it was part of that so obviously in the future the best

266
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:50.849
Phoenix: it. It would be advisable to add a create plan, label, or something to this button. Let's look at creating this plan

267
00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.020
Phoenix: awesome.

268
00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:58.990
Phoenix: We're just gonna put the number one.

269
00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:07.560
Phoenix: Mr. Hoffman Hendell

270
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:13.119
Phoenix: so much left we can put none at that.

271
00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:21.130
Phoenix: I don't know

272
00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.249
Phoenix: your test. One test.

273
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:28.080
Phoenix: Okay? So we'll say

274
00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:32.559
Phoenix: we'll just put the plans. Budget at 6,000, because that's our monthly income.

275
00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.430
Phoenix: Just fine.

276
00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.020
Okay, hold on. Don't worry.

277
00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:48.159
Phoenix: Sorry. Sometimes I have a difficult time finding the 0. There we go. Okay. Nothing awesome.

278
00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.890
Phoenix: That's fine fun.

279
00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:55.939
Phoenix: Okay, we'll give it a deadline date

280
00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:04.769
Phoenix: for some day next month in March. Let's say, done so that this keyboard box goes away.

281
00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:09.750
Phoenix: Next month

282
00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:13.650
Phoenix: we'll do March sixth. Okay, number 4.

283
00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:22.989
Phoenix: Double tap on. Add plan.

284
00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:27.939
Phoenix: Alright. Now let's look at the analysis results. So we'll go back to the main menu.

285
00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.440
Phoenix: Let's look at budget analysis.

286
00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:40.969
Phoenix: Okay, no. But rob is fine. 100,000 and tragic and dark, doesn't

287
00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:50.790
Phoenix: which? So there's a lot about this that is not accessible. It it doesn't tell you.

288
00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:59.270
Phoenix: I mean it really doesn't break down the individual elements of the chart. So like, for example, let's look at it together.

289
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:03.930
Phoenix: Okay.

290
00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:16.709
Phoenix: so this I don't understand. The one points thing, the min value and the Max value are both 150, and that's probably because I only added 1 $150 expense to this.

291
00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:19.660
but it's not presented in a clear

292
00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:27.080
Phoenix: category like in in clear information. You know, you spent this amount of money this month.

293
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:29.240
Phoenix: and like, don't talk like

294
00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.430
Phoenix: which.

295
00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:42.299
Phoenix: So then there's food and bills and food and 0 0. I don't know what any of those are. I apologize. It started talking by itself.

296
00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.330
So I don't know what those expenses are.

297
00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:53.089
Phoenix: I, don't they? So some more descriptive labels will be helpful for this chart. Let's go back to the main menu. Okay.

298
00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:58.610
Phoenix: let's look at the monthly expenses of that analysis.

299
00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:03.970
Phoenix: Just fine. Thank you.

300
00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:12.649
Phoenix: I mean, does. And this just simply says nothing it it says Web View.

301
00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:20.179
Phoenix: but it doesn't give you any kind of indication of what's in this web view. So I would say, overall this app.

302
00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:23.170
You can definitely tell that it

303
00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:30.929
Phoenix: it appears to be in a prototype stage, but it's coming along very nicely. A few more descriptive labels on the

304
00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:38.950
Phoenix: titles of text fields would be helpful. There is absolutely no information provided in the

305
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.740
Phoenix: monthly analysis.

306
00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:49.379
Phoenix: I believe, is the one that we're on right now. So some descriptors for the charts, or I'm not certain what it visually shows.

307
00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:53.560
Phoenix: And then the the

308
00:26:54.110 --> 00:27:02.980
Phoenix: budget analysis. It has similar problems. There are. There's a little bit of data that's presented, but it's not clearly able to be interpreted.

309
00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:11.490
Phoenix: But I believe that this app is well on its way. It, I think in a few months time it could be more accessible.

310
00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:22.399
Phoenix: With all of that being said, I apologize that this video took longer than it should have. I was trying to familiarize myself with the app, and I do hope that my

311
00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.879
Phoenix: test has been helpful, and thank you so much for watching.
