00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:05.630
Hassan: There we go.

2
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.220
Hassan: Hello! Welcome to this task. My name is Hassan.

3
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.430
Hassan: I'm a test here. Here. I fable

4
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:25.580
Hassan: Today i'll be using a dragon, naturally speaking, and so alternative alternative navigation method. on my dell laptop

5
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.430
Hassan: using windows 10.

6
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.780
Hassan: So as you can see here, I'm already logged in to the upscale Qa environment.

7
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.170
Hassan: and my task today is to navigate to the

8
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.389
Hassan: getting started in Web Development Course.

9
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.129
Hassan: which I will complete the first module of.

10
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.750
Hassan: and afterwards I will click on courses

11
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.340
Hassan: to see what percentage of the course I have completed.

12
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.670
Hassan: So throughout that process you may give commands

13
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.899
Hassan: 2 dragons, such as you know, to wake up, record, asleep.

14
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.700
Hassan: or to click on this link or that link.

15
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.929
Hassan: so I just want to give you a heads up.

16
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.000
Hassan: Primarily I will be saying

17
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:18.509
Hassan: show links as a method of showing clickable links in the module itself. If that does not work.

18
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.830
Hassan: I will try to say the name of the link.

19
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.579
Hassan: If that doesn't work I will

20
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.440
Hassan: divide the screen into a grid.

21
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.479
Hassan: and hopefully h down

22
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.679
Hassan: the area of which I want to click.

23
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.430
Hassan: So let's get started.

24
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.389
Hassan: oh, sorry. I forgot to mention. I will be using Google Chrome

25
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.420
Hassan: with this.

26
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.439
Hassan: Wake up.

27
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.860
Hassan: show links.

28
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.229
Hassan: Oh, click, cancel.

29
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.369
Hassan: mouse, click.

30
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.050
Hassan: pitch down.

31
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.520
Hassan: show links.

32
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.750
Hassan: choose 8

33
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.180
Hassan: page down.

34
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.850
Hassan: show links.

35
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.790
Hassan: choose 9.

36
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.310
Hassan: Go down, 5,

37
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.100
Hassan: go down 5.

38
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.920
Hassan: Okay. So here i'm just reading on

39
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.450
Hassan: what? Exactly I will be doing in this task.

40
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.269
Hassan: Under learning outcomes.

41
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.760
Hassan: So apparently I will learn about

42
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.360
Hassan: visual studio code and get home.

43
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.520
Hassan: which should open in a new tab.

44
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.170
Hassan: Okay, I will continue to go down.

45
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.290
Hassan: wake up.

46
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:48.609
Hassan: go down 5,

47
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.840
Hassan: go down 5.

48
00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.829
Hassan: Go down 5,

49
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.129
Hassan: go down 5

50
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.630
Hassan: show links.

51
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.290
Hassan: choose 10

52
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.329
Hassan: show links.

53
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.060
Hassan: Mouse click.

54
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.739
Hassan: Sorry, Hannah. Just one question for you.

55
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:35.600
Hassan: Page. Down.

56
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.400
Hassan: Page, down.

57
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.219
Hassan: go up 5

58
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.070
Hassan: go to see.

59
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.349
Hassan: So I will be interacting with this video.

60
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:59.300
Hassan: so i'm not going to watch all of it. But I will try to interact with the control, such as play. Pause, sending volumes turning on captions.

61
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.049
Hassan: and then, if that works I will be moving on.

62
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.250
Hassan: So let's do that wake up.

63
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.890
Hassan: Miles, click.

64
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.130
Hassan: show lengths.

65
00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.410
Hassan: mouse, click.

66
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.160
Hassan: mouse, double click

67
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:24.880
Hassan: presses. Kate.

68
00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.040
Okay.

69
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:29.430
Hassan: page down.

70
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.230
Hassan: page down.

71
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.090
Hassan: I was click.

72
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.819
Hassan: show links.

73
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:44.720
Hassan: two's, 12

74
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:48.860
Hassan: show links.

75
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.630
Hassan: Choose 11

76
00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.100
Hassan: like full screen

77
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.390
Hassan: mouse, double click.

78
00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.010
Hassan: mouse, double click.

79
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.400
Hassan: courtesy.

80
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.760
Hassan: Okay. So as you see there.

81
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.409
Hassan: So the controls actually go away after you. However.

82
00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.039
Hassan: after video.

83
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.850
Hassan: and then it's very hard to bring the controls back up

84
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.500
Hassan: by sure, by saying show links.

85
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.630
Hassan: I was able to do it, but I think that was mostly by fluke.

86
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.949
Hassan: I don't the first time I was trying to do it.

87
00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.659
Hassan: it was not labeling the controls, and

88
00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.689
Hassan: I was unable to activate the captions

89
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.370
Hassan: but the second time apparently it just

90
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.589
Hassan: it was showing the controls again, and I was able to bring it up.

91
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.740
Hassan: so I think

92
00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.940
Hassan: the best practice would be to make those controls always there at least

93
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.769
Hassan: and maybe until you full screen the video

94
00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.850
Hassan: that way. You can access those things, those controls by voice.

95
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:15.790
Hassan: And the second thing I would have tried if that did not work is to refresh the page.

96
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.849
Hassan: And you know, I have the when the video now start.

97
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.310
Hassan: In the first place, that way I can

98
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.759
Hassan: set my captions before I actually start.

99
00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.040
Hassan: So now that we have the video going in full screen.

100
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.290
Hassan: i'm gonna try to see if

101
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:33.400
Hassan: I can

102
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:37.080
Hassan: manipulate the video in this way.

103
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.280
Hassan: Wake up.

104
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:40.660
Hassan: mouse, click

105
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.290
Hassan: us escape

106
00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:50.870
Hassan: page down.

107
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:53.429
Hassan: Page. Now.

108
00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:56.200
Hassan: Miles, click

109
00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:58.490
Hassan: for the seat.

110
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:05.250
Hassan: So another thing I notice is that when you are playing a video in full screen.

111
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.970
Hassan: and you say, press escape to exit

112
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.660
Hassan: full screen. It brings you back up to the top of the page

113
00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:16.409
Hassan: so that might not always be ideal, because your mouse

114
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.880
Hassan: a position might not be hovering over the video

115
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.919
Hassan: in which case it would be hard to

116
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.590
Hassan: navigate the mouse to the video.

117
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:27.780
Hassan: using voice alone

118
00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.860
Hassan: and having a click on the end.

119
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:32.380
Hassan: So I think

120
00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:34.260
Hassan: if you start

121
00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.169
Hassan: full screen over the video, for example.

122
00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:41.249
Hassan: Maybe a more.

123
00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:44.310
Hassan: I guess. Easier way of

124
00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:48.310
Hassan: Entering and examining full screen

125
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.310
Hassan: would be to keep the mouse cursor

126
00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.009
Hassan: within the initial location

127
00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.919
Hassan: which is over the video in the first.

128
00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:01.870
Hassan: So now that we have done that, I will go down through balm

129
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.170
Hassan: and see if there's anything else I can do.

130
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:06.010
Hassan: Wake up.

131
00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:08.590
Hassan: go down 5

132
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.409
Hassan: edge down.

133
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:18.780
Hassan: show links.

134
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.149
Hassan: choose 12.

135
00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.520
Hassan: Go to see.

136
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:42.209
Hassan: Okay, so that's good that it clearly shows you which part of the module you're on.

137
00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:45.170
Hassan: and apparently I have completed the

138
00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:49.709
Hassan: first task in the module, and i'm on to the second one.

139
00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.650
Hassan: so again this is.

140
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.529
Hassan: I believe this is a video. But let's go down and see.

141
00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:57.590
Hassan: Wake up.

142
00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.049
Hassan: go down 5,

143
00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.189
Hassan: go down 5

144
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.470
Hassan: miles, click.

145
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:13.260
Hassan: show links.

146
00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.810
Hassan: choose 18

147
00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:19.729
Hassan: Go up 5

148
00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:22.509
Hassan: Go up 5,

149
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:23.870
Hassan: Hey, John

150
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.180
Hassan: Mouse double-click

151
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.180
Hassan: bus escaped

152
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:34.220
Hassan: mouse click.

153
00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:37.600
Hassan: go to it.

154
00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:42.999
Hassan: This video I believe was much easier to control because

155
00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:46.589
Hassan: as seen on this page. There's nothing more than

156
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:49.469
Hassan: just a video. So there's no

157
00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.540
Hassan: you know. Paragraphs are text

158
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.770
Hassan: that one has to navigate to.

159
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:59.570
Hassan: But one thing I also found is that although the controls disappeared

160
00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.710
Hassan: after a couple of seconds

161
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:04.189
Hassan: numbers, when I said show links

162
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:11.570
Hassan: stayed in the you know over the controls. So if I saw one number corresponded

163
00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:14.180
Hassan: to the close captioning button.

164
00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:18.030
Hassan: then I would be able to, you know. Just say that number.

165
00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.819
Hassan: but for that I thank you. After

166
00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.600
Hassan: memorize, basically one number that grows Monday to.

167
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:29.960
Hassan: So again, I think an easier method might be

168
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.240
Hassan: to keep the controls there for a bit.

169
00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:36.360
Hassan: Besides that, this one, I believe, was

170
00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:39.100
Hassan: an easier activity than the first one.

171
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:42.830
Hassan: Okay.

172
00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:46.109
Hassan: So I will go on to the next activity. Now

173
00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:47.150
Hassan: wake up.

174
00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:49.190
Hassan: page down.

175
00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.370
Hassan: show links.

176
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:54.330
Hassan: choose 18.

177
00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.270
Hassan: Go down 5,

178
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.620
Hassan: go down 5,

179
00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.050

Hassan: go to seat.

183
00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:41.629
Hassan: Okay. This one, I think, is also straightforward, because, most of the

184
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.939
Hassan: that. The there's mostly tax on this page.

185
00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:49.980
Hassan: there's no other object to interact with it as a video.

186
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:53.630
Hassan: there is a link here that clearly says.

187
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:55.819
Hassan: opens a new tab.

188
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.600

Hassan: Go to the first tab.

196
00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:19.880
Hassan: Good. Is it?

197
00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:22.980
Hassan: Okay, so that was simple enough.

198
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:24.240
Hassan: that

199
00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.550
Hassan: open the second tab without interfering with my

200
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:30.670
Hassan: the open page I have right now.

201
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.650
Hassan: And yeah.

202
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:36.709
Hassan: So this one. I would give it for Mars, because it was very simple.

203
00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:40.479
Hassan: so let's go on to the next. I to activity. Now

204
00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:41.530

Hassan: show links.

216
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.349
Hassan: miles grid and 9

217
00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:34.650
Hassan: 2,

218
00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:38.330
Hassan: 5,

219
00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:40.720
Hassan: 2

220
00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.080
Hassan: start dried up.

221
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:48.560
Hassan: Mouse, drag up

222
00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:51.619
Hassan: my strike up.

223
00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:54.750
Hassan: Has escaped.

224
00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:58.430
Hassan: Go to sleep.

225
00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.259
Hassan: Okay. So here we have. We really on the page again.

226
00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:06.229
Hassan: and I find it much easier now to

227
00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.730
Hassan: user controls, but I think it's more simple.

228
00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:12.149
Hassan: before you start the video

229
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.449
Hassan: that we can manipulate. For example, here

230
00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.880
Hassan: I was able to adjust the volume, using only voice.

231
00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:21.650
Hassan: and one thing I notice is that

232
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:25.079
Hassan: if you start a video on the first task there.

233
00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:28.939
Hassan: in the first activity it keeps your preference

234
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.449
Hassan: throughout the whole thing, apparently. And

235
00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:33.060
Hassan: that

236
00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.129
Hassan: That's why, when I click on close captioning

237
00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:39.190
Hassan: on this video. It already new

238
00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:42.789
Hassan: that I turn on English close captioning

239
00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.880
Hassan: no previous videos. So that's a good name.

240
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:50.729
Hassan: and that's very good that I can manipulate the volume, using voice

241
00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:54.469
Hassan: And again, i'll just click play

242
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:57.020
Hassan: just to see if it can be done.

243
00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:01.529
Hassan: And then actually, one thing I haven't done in the previous activities

244
00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.270
Hassan: is click on video transcript

245
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:06.720
Hassan: to see what that's all about.

246
00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:09.429
Hassan: So I will do that. And then, after that

247
00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:12.720
Hassan: I will go to the last task.

248
00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.630
Hassan: Wake up.

249
00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:17.990
Hassan: press, escape.

267
00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.370

Hassan: page down.

269
00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:36.029
Hassan: go to sleep.

270
00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:39.519
Hassan: Okay, this is very well done.

271
00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:43.119
Hassan: I have come across images in the past. Where?

272
00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:46.180
Hassan: if there's a slide show, for example.

273
00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:49.059
Hassan: you have to. You can't continuously

274
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:51.920
Hassan: click back, or you know, Go forward.

275
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.310
Hassan: or you will have to

276
00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:58.109
Hassan: For example, there' be no way to access those controls.

277
00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.050
Hassan: using voice or saying show links.

278
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.099
Hassan: They won't even be numbered.

279
00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:07.850
Hassan: So the fact that these are numbered everything seems for accessible

280
00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:08.620
Hassan: here

281
00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:15.399
Hassan: and this is something I really appreciate, because it makes using a web page much easier for me.

282
00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:19.669
Hassan: and I believe our users using my technology would

283
00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.609
Hassan: also appreciate this, because again.

284
00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:27.350
Hassan: You don't want to feel stressed out, never getting through something

285
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.929
Hassan: as she, if it's important to your task.

286
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:33.940
Hassan: so I believe this is very well done.

287
00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.880
Hassan: so apparently. Here

288
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:39.999
Hassan: it seems like, we are done with the first. Much

289
00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:44.290
Hassan: so what I will do now. I I will click on courses

290
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.570
Hassan: and see how much of the course

291
00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:49.050
Hassan: what percentage I have access

292
00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.190
Hassan: actually. finished there.

293
00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:52.920
Hassan: Well, let's do that now.

294
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:54.409
Hassan: and wake up.

295
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:56.860
Hassan: Show links.

296
00:18:58.740 --> 00:18:59.760
Hassan: Choose to

297
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.560
Hassan: Page. Now

298
00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.250
Hassan: go down 5.

299
00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:15.779
Hassan: Good to see.

300
00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:22.729
Hassan: Okay, so that was pretty simple. I was able to navigate everything using Royce.

301
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.579
Hassan: and I can clearly see here that

302
00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:28.639
Hassan: I have done 17 of the scores.

303
00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:32.980
Hassan: so the information one would seek to

304
00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.859
Hassan: find out is very easily available.

305
00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:38.220
Hassan: I find. And

306
00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:42.070
Hassan: As for my final thoughts on

307
00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:44.380
Hassan: so I believe everything is

308
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.060
Hassan: perfectly well done.

309
00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:49.589
Hassan: except I think, area for improvements could be

310
00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.620
Hassan: having the control 0 permanently.

311
00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:54.769
Hassan: or maybe a in.

312
00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:56.339
Hassan: you know, having them

313
00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:00.060
Hassan: appear in such a way that they don't disappear

314
00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:02.870
Hassan: after a certain amount of seconds, so that

315
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:06.260
Hassan: people using voice control could easily.

316
00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.940
Hassan: you know, turn them on or off at will.

317
00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:12.000
Hassan: and

318
00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:15.359
Hassan: for example, if they want to scrub through the radio.

319
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:18.429
Hassan: change the volume that could be easily done.

320
00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.069
Hassan: As long as the controls don't

321
00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.600
Hassan: no disappear too fast

322
00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.780
Hassan: which can cause confusion.

323
00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:30.019
Hassan: But besides that I find everything is well done here.

324
00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.700
Hassan: Lots of white space, lots of

325
00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:36.010
Hassan: the Transcript. The video transcript was

326
00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.370
Hassan: easy to click on and read from there.

327
00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:43.860
Hassan: so even if one does not want to watch the video or

328
00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:48.050
Hassan: it has some other issues with it.

329
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.750
Hassan: They can always go to the Transcript

330
00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:53.509
Hassan: and read everything from there.

331
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:56.239
Hassan: So again, this sum up, I think.

332
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.600
Hassan: The majority of this was perfectly well done.

333
00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:02.930
Hassan: just area for improvement would be Video.

334
00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:05.720
Hassan: Besides that, I just

335
00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.470
Hassan: you know a job very well done again.

336
00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:09.900
Hassan: So

337
00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:10.610
Hassan: yeah.

338
00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:13.409
Hassan: I just want to wrap this up again.

339
00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:16.320
Hassan: Thank you for choosing fable for your needs.

340
00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:19.320
Hassan: Well, you are favorable, but thank you so much.

341
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:21.679
Hassan: and I hope you have a nice week ahead.

342
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.770
Hassan: Thank you.
