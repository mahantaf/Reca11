00:00:13.994 --> 00:00:39.054
Kostantino: my vision is 20 by 1,300, which means what you see at 1,300 feet. I have to be 20 feet away from to see. That means that I do live in that magnification world, and that magnification world for me is powered by apple. I have a macbook pro and an imac that are both connected to a 78 inch screen located about 18 inches away from my face.

2
00:00:39.214 --> 00:00:52.064
Kostantino: All software is completely up to date on the Mac OS system as well as on Ios. I do use an iphone and an ipad. 90% of the time it is the iphone.

3
00:00:52.144 --> 00:01:08.903
Kostantino: I do primarily use Apple's accessibility technologies and settings. Although I do have some third party apps and software that I do use. I don't anticipate having to use anything beyond the apple settings. Today

4
00:01:09.574 --> 00:01:21.823
Kostantino: we are engaging with the Macbook Pro and Zoom here, and although there are some differences between accessibility settings in Ios and Macos.

5
00:01:22.234 --> 00:01:24.054
There will

6
00:01:24.374 --> 00:01:51.453
Kostantino: more than likely be a situation where I hit the physical limitations of the at and the settings, in which case I might have to use my low tech devices, which include my glasses. Pardon me as I stretch for one of my others. I have 16 pairs of glasses, yellow, orange, and green. I do use a traditional magnifier at times, as well as some

7
00:01:51.454 --> 00:01:55.014
concave and convex glass lenses.

8
00:01:55.014 --> 00:02:14.403
Kostantino: I may or may not use my monocular, which is traditionally used for long distances or far away distances, but I use them when I'm looking at certain images or text that might be too small. I may or may not use my desktop 5 x or 10 x magnification lamps.

9
00:02:14.494 --> 00:02:20.443
Kostantino: Although I don't think that I will need to because we are in Mac OS

10
00:02:20.884 --> 00:02:49.993
Kostantino: 2 final quick caveats before we move forward. The first is that we are using zoom on Mac OS today, and unfortunately, when I invert my colors, which I usually am inverted about 90% of the time, you won't not be able to see those inverted colors, you will see the default layout. I will do my best to try and tell you what those colors look like, and what that contrast appears like.

11
00:02:50.344 --> 00:02:51.484
But.

12
00:02:51.724 --> 00:03:00.564
Kostantino: you will not be able to see anything other than a quick pop-up model that says color contrast on or off.

13
00:03:00.754 --> 00:03:04.813
That will be your clue, but I will also let you know.

14
00:03:04.994 --> 00:03:35.403
Kostantino: Secondly, there's a variety of different ways of magnifying. I've counted over 20 I use 3 more than any of the other ones, and there are 2 additional modes of magnification that you will not be able to see. One of them I don't use as much as the other, and that one, of course, is using the option. Command 8 key, which will magnify the entire screen

15
00:03:35.404 --> 00:03:45.684
Kostantino: again. I will do my best to describe to you what is on my macbook crow screen at that time. So onwards and upwards

16
00:03:45.684 --> 00:04:10.384
Kostantino: today I'm thrilled to be working with fable. That's an understatement, and I am taking on the role of reviewing up skill. I am looking at this learning platform and the courses, because I happen to be a learning manager who has been given access to the demo and the appropriate credentials which I've used to sign in

17
00:04:10.384 --> 00:04:22.093
Kostantino: the objective today is to look around and explore as much as possible. See how usable and understandable the upscale site is.

18
00:04:22.104 --> 00:04:27.133
Kostantino: and providing an overall rating on how the experience was

19
00:04:27.184 --> 00:04:39.964
Kostantino: of note. I will not need to go through the entire course. The course has a variety of dummy content. This is more about the experience, and being able to navigate.

20
00:04:40.244 --> 00:04:42.694
So that being the case.

21
00:04:43.194 --> 00:04:54.264
Kostantino: I'm just gonna quickly hit my control option. Command 8 so that you could get a look at what the popup looks like invert display color on or off.

22
00:04:54.444 --> 00:04:56.683
Kostantino: I'm in the default. Look right now.

23
00:04:57.084 --> 00:05:09.314
Kostantino: Everything is white for the most part. We have a little bit of grey out on the background, because there is a white pop up that is very, very, very bright for me.

24
00:05:09.904 --> 00:05:31.283
Kostantino: The good news is that I know from my time with fable engagements, that we have some great typography. So when it comes to scaling and being able to read things it is very, very well done. Kudos to the fable design and dev team, of course.

25
00:05:31.514 --> 00:05:49.094
Kostantino: So what I now have is a black screen with really bright white text on that black again. I'm not overly looking at the magnification right now. I'm just trying to get a sense of what my contrast looks like.

26
00:05:49.144 --> 00:05:51.204
Kostantino: which is amazing.

27
00:05:51.314 --> 00:06:09.294
Kostantino: Because we are in safari. I'm really happy. I will be able to use both my pinch to zoom functionality as well as command plus minus. If I do need to use my option, command 8. I will let you know and tell you where we're at, so

28
00:06:09.664 --> 00:06:12.534
Kostantino: I can see here

29
00:06:12.754 --> 00:06:14.723
Kostantino: that we have

30
00:06:16.704 --> 00:06:18.744
Kostantino: little bit of a plus.

31
00:06:19.864 --> 00:06:30.134
Kostantino: very interesting. I just hit command plus a couple times, and the responsiveness of the site really changed.

32
00:06:31.334 --> 00:06:36.374
Kostantino: and we seem to be locked into very

33
00:06:37.124 --> 00:06:41.024
Kostantino: small window. That's a little bit bigger.

34
00:06:41.514 --> 00:06:57.443
Kostantino: So it's responsive on my command, plus which is great welcome to fable upscale. I love this typography. I really really like the font. It is so

35
00:06:57.514 --> 00:07:04.964
Kostantino: magnification-friendly again. Great job! So we have some content.

36
00:07:07.784 --> 00:07:14.223
Kostantino: All right. So I just used command plus twice there. If I come out of it.

37
00:07:14.364 --> 00:07:22.503
Kostantino: It's not scaling back the way that it should be very odd behavior.

38
00:07:22.704 --> 00:07:30.014
Kostantino: I'm gonna try and command plus in try and do the best that I can with my pinch to zoom.

39
00:07:35.414 --> 00:07:36.224
Kostantino: Oh.

40
00:07:37.544 --> 00:07:42.344
Kostantino: okay, I think I touched maybe the video.

41
00:07:42.364 --> 00:07:51.594
Kostantino: but I could quickly press the space bar to stop down here. Looks like we've got some blue on the black.

42
00:07:51.764 --> 00:08:03.094
Kostantino: It's not so bad because it is a little bit of a brighter blue and as I hover over I'm very happy to see a hover state change, which is great.

43
00:08:03.194 --> 00:08:14.383
Kostantino: I'm also able to see that there has been a color change on the button itself, meaning that it is likely actionable.

44
00:08:14.524 --> 00:08:20.553
Kostantino: That being the case, if I wanted to start the tour, I probably could.

45
00:08:20.794 --> 00:08:29.944
Kostantino:  But I'm gonna assume that for the sake of experience, I could turn on the video on and off as I just did.

46
00:08:30.044 --> 00:08:33.143
Kostantino: I would be able to magnify to see

47
00:08:33.334 --> 00:08:36.574
Kostantino: some of these settings. The problem is

48
00:08:36.613 --> 00:08:56.283
Kostantino: that I would have to temporarily come out of my inverted contrast. And just a side note. My invert settings are classic invert, which inverts everything on the screen as opposed to smart invert, which doesn't invert media, icons, images, logos, etc., etc.

49
00:08:56.464 --> 00:09:02.474
Kostantino: I can definitely see a nice bright red as I'm hovering over these icons.

50
00:09:02.484 --> 00:09:14.903
Kostantino: I would look to magnify them a little bit more. But you can now see, or I can now see, that at the bottom of the screen it's all white. If I come back into my inverted classic

51
00:09:14.994 --> 00:09:25.933
Kostantino: colors, then we've got the white up here, and that kind of blinds me with some of this content. The other comment that I would make is that

52
00:09:26.054 --> 00:09:29.083
Kostantino:  It looks like

53
00:09:30.304 --> 00:09:32.473
Kostantino: we've got some kind of

54
00:09:32.714 --> 00:09:44.934
Kostantino: fluorescent green, but it it looks more like a fluorescent peacock green, maybe. And it really doesn't contrast well against the background.

55
00:09:45.194 --> 00:10:01.894
Kostantino: One thing that I'm gonna mention right here is that because we're in the video. And the way that videos work. All of the text in the vigil is definitely pixelated for me. When I see pixelation, it, it actually vibrates the text. So

56
00:10:01.894 --> 00:10:16.544
Kostantino: that is definitely different text and a different magnification than with the typography that I've spoken about up at the top. So assuming that I just want to get out of it, I could just

57
00:10:16.594 --> 00:10:20.644
Kostantino: click anywhere and hit escape, which was great.

58
00:10:21.054 --> 00:10:38.233
Kostantino:  I am going to quickly. Just come back here. And the one thing that I'm gonna say is. I really liked the way that this responsiveness on the site is working. Now

59
00:10:38.274 --> 00:10:40.224
Kostantino: there is my

60
00:10:40.384 --> 00:10:47.804
Kostantino: fable logo, which I'm pretty familiar with.  I've gotten used to this kind of

61
00:10:47.974 --> 00:10:49.374
Kostantino: mustards.

62
00:10:49.954 --> 00:11:03.264
Kostantino: greenish kind of shade that we have on the site. I prefer to see it be a brighter yellow or a brighter orange, but I can appreciate that. It's not just about me. It is about so many other users.

63
00:11:03.584 --> 00:11:06.774
Kostantino: There is our hamburger, which is great.

64
00:11:07.914 --> 00:11:18.563
Kostantino: And one thing that I can see right off the bat. That is much easier if I come back out by using my command minus.

65
00:11:18.654 --> 00:11:21.284
Kostantino: and then quickly shrink.

66
00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:38.944
Kostantino: I can see that there are a couple of images which means that I may or may not have a little bit more difficulty separating those images. It kind of looks like one for me. There is a very tiny sliver of black, but that might be the same photograph.

67
00:11:39.134 --> 00:11:52.463
Kostantino: What I do like about the responsiveness, notwithstanding the pop-up that we just have to deal with with the introduction video is, if I do come back and hit my command plus keys.

68
00:11:52.704 --> 00:11:58.013
Kostantino: Then we've gotten into a very streamlined look.

69
00:11:58.094 --> 00:12:16.623
Kostantino: There's definitely been a trend towards the simplification of websites. I'm a very big fan of that trend. I'm not overly interested in content or images that don't inform me. I'm more about the text and the information.

70
00:12:16.794 --> 00:12:26.974
Kostantino: What I do like is that again, this has taken that single kind of page format which I really really like.

71
00:12:26.984 --> 00:12:32.464
Kostantino:  I also see a somewhat

72
00:12:32.534 --> 00:12:41.474
Kostantino: thin outline around what may be one of the courses within upscale, or at least that's what I'm thinking.

73
00:12:41.724 --> 00:12:54.264
Kostantino: The challenge for me is that the picture is not inverted. This is classic invert, so everything should invert. I don't know why that setting is like it is.

74
00:12:54.334 --> 00:12:56.673
Kostantino: but if anybody should know

75
00:12:56.774 --> 00:13:07.014
Kostantino: it's fable, we should not be overriding the accessibility settings of the user. So in my case.

76
00:13:07.074 --> 00:13:13.064
Kostantino: I am looking for classic invert, and I expect everything to invert.

77
00:13:14.164 --> 00:13:18.653
Kostantino: so it looks like we've got different sections.

78
00:13:20.444 --> 00:13:31.554
Kostantino: Oh. up here towards where the picture is. I really don't see any type of outline when it comes to outlines and focus.

79
00:13:31.814 --> 00:13:40.564
Kostantino:  it should be beyond just color. So it's great that I can actually see a line

80
00:13:40.614 --> 00:13:43.193
Kostantino: in addition to the color.

81
00:13:43.374 --> 00:13:53.903
Kostantino: Sometimes I would like to see lines that are maybe dashed or much older, so that they could really let me know that of course I am on actionable content.

82
00:13:53.984 --> 00:13:58.004
Kostantino: But this simplicity is really really wonderful.

83
00:13:58.154 --> 00:14:03.353
Kostantino: I very quickly am able to understand that I am

84
00:14:03.814 --> 00:14:14.923
Kostantino: top right, hamburger, top, left logo, single column, and the ability to use my pinch to zoom

85
00:14:15.174 --> 00:14:19.713
Kostantino: courses is a little bit creamish, but that's okay.

86
00:14:20.034 --> 00:14:27.724
Kostantino: my active courses, nice, big, bright old white. I'm a big fan of 21 to one.

87
00:14:27.994 --> 00:14:33.484
Kostantino: It looks like we've got some longer words here. So I'm just gonna

88
00:14:33.894 --> 00:14:43.334
Kostantino: command, plus. it looks like that's the most that I could really get to means a little bit more. Leaning in

89
00:14:44.514 --> 00:14:46.924
Kostantino: my accessibility journey.

90
00:14:48.004 --> 00:14:52.634
Kostantino: I see the word Beta. I think I see some blue in the background

91
00:14:52.704 --> 00:15:04.153
Kostantino: again. It's okay. But this blue against the black doesn't contrast as well as maybe something like, you know, a bright yellow or a bright orange.

92
00:15:04.704 --> 00:15:16.954
Kostantino: So I was able to look at my active courses. Very scalable when it comes to the typography, and being able to really kind of ramp that up a little bit.

93
00:15:17.574 --> 00:15:20.284
Kostantino: We've got this kind of

94
00:15:20.584 --> 00:15:23.784
Kostantino: brownish, mustardy yellow

95
00:15:24.124 --> 00:15:31.714
Kostantino: shade, that appears. I would absolutely like to see that replaced with like a very, very bright orange

96
00:15:31.844 --> 00:15:38.223
Kostantino: that may or may not cause some contrast issues, because that would typically be a dark blue or a link blue.

97
00:15:38.234 --> 00:15:40.414
Kostantino: But again.

98
00:15:40.424 --> 00:15:42.334
Kostantino: I'm able to

99
00:15:42.694 --> 00:15:44.194
understand that

100
00:15:44.664 --> 00:15:49.004
Kostantino: really, really bright white circle. I don't understand

101
00:15:51.494 --> 00:15:54.993
what that looks like. So I'm just gonna invert color contrast out

102
00:15:55.344 --> 00:16:00.753
Kostantino: all right. I've now inverted out of my classic and color contrast.

103
00:16:00.844 --> 00:16:10.403
Kostantino: It's still gray. This is all gray. It's still gray when I move into the black which I've just done now it's a whiteish gray with more. I

104
00:16:10.534 --> 00:16:22.654
Kostantino: I really am not able to see that at all. I can see that it's a circle. I can see that it's bright.  I think that I had seen the word badge.

105
00:16:26.104 --> 00:16:33.084
Kostantino: Yeah. badges. So that might be a badge, and if it is a badge. Then

106
00:16:34.184 --> 00:16:38.213
Kostantino: then I should be able to see that badge. Maybe it's gray, because

107
00:16:38.344 --> 00:16:50.554
Kostantino: no badge has been earned, in which case maybe you could just use the words, no badge, or you would maybe just have text there saying, Earn your first badge.

108
00:16:50.664 --> 00:16:54.754
Kostantino: That would be a little bit of a positive incentive as well.

109
00:16:54.894 --> 00:16:58.133
Kostantino: I'm gonna come down here to this section.

110
00:16:58.494 --> 00:17:00.693
Kostantino: That's my command, plus

111
00:17:02.334 --> 00:17:05.853
Kostantino: yeah, very responsive, which is great.

112
00:17:06.043 --> 00:17:21.953
Kostantino: I'm really a big fan of Dom's that made sense and that are not huge. Of course we know the bigger Dom is, the less responsive of site might be which absolutely impacts the ux.

113
00:17:22.023 --> 00:17:33.184
Kostantino: So far I could say that I'm really impressed. There is definitely some more content down here. Looks like we've got another course

114
00:17:35.344 --> 00:17:36.284
canoe

115
00:17:36.434 --> 00:17:40.494
Kostantino: pitch to zoom gonna now, plus

116
00:17:41.544 --> 00:17:53.754
Kostantino: to the most that I can learn about accessibility. I am so thrilled at how wonderful our font and typography is on this particular page.

117
00:17:54.234 --> 00:17:57.123
Kostantino: So I'd continue to deal with

118
00:17:58.634 --> 00:18:04.743
Kostantino: that content. Got this yellow line here, which I want to.

119
00:18:06.944 --> 00:18:07.874
Okay.

120
00:18:09.164 --> 00:18:14.794
Kostantino: overall progress. Alright. So that is my progress bill, which is great.

121
00:18:14.824 --> 00:18:25.874
Kostantino: I don't know as we go through the Progress, what that might look like. Looks like. We've got all of these courses that I can engage with.

122
00:18:26.094 --> 00:18:36.914
Kostantino: I really really like the perceivability and understandability. There's not a wall of text

123
00:18:37.054 --> 00:18:39.293
Kostantino: I'm able to very

124
00:18:39.364 --> 00:18:46.024
Kostantino: easily and succinctly. I just wish that I could really get to just a tiny bit.

125
00:18:46.284 --> 00:18:56.934
Kostantino: So there's my option command, plus. yeah, the typography at this level, which is probably sitting at around

126
00:18:57.394 --> 00:19:01.234
Kostantino: 6 or 700% give or take.

127
00:19:01.444 --> 00:19:04.044
Kostantino: it is really, really clean and crisp.

128
00:19:05.154 --> 00:19:15.934
Kostantino: I can see my manicure here, which means that I have an actionable. So I'm now going to read the contents

129
00:19:17.854 --> 00:19:19.074
Kostantino: and just

130
00:19:21.424 --> 00:19:25.373
Kostantino: how to create mobile apps that work

131
00:19:26.844 --> 00:19:28.954
Kostantino: well for users.

132
00:19:30.484 --> 00:19:31.244
Cool

133
00:19:33.914 --> 00:19:35.044
Kostantino: 18

134
00:19:36.224 --> 00:19:45.184
Kostantino: to lose. Okay? So I know that these are dummy links. Oops.

135
00:19:46.254 --> 00:19:51.814
Kostantino: Let's come out with command, minus a little bit more.

136
00:19:53.224 --> 00:19:56.633
Kostantino: I'm just gonna try and get back to.

137
00:20:02.504 --> 00:20:13.594
Kostantino: We have 2 elements up here. Great. So it's a little bit interesting up top. I've now got 2 white

138
00:20:14.094 --> 00:20:16.444
Kostantino: words and

139
00:20:17.254 --> 00:20:19.504
Kostantino: going to try and read them.

140
00:20:26.304 --> 00:20:34.973
Kostantino: Yeah. So if I now come out command minus once I am able to see

141
00:20:37.194 --> 00:20:38.044
Kostantino: no

142
00:20:40.564 --> 00:20:43.194
Kostantino: dashboard and courses.

143
00:20:43.464 --> 00:20:46.223
Kostantino:  But if I

144
00:20:46.544 --> 00:20:49.354
Kostantino: if I try and scale that

145
00:20:50.364 --> 00:20:51.234
Kostantino: up

146
00:20:53.754 --> 00:20:57.584
Kostantino: now the Hamburger has disappeared.

147
00:20:59.214 --> 00:21:02.724
Kostantino: and I've got a user option in the top

148
00:21:03.104 --> 00:21:07.484
Kostantino: here, I can tell, because I've got a hover state change.

149
00:21:08.714 --> 00:21:11.533
Kostantino: We have options here.

150
00:21:14.164 --> 00:21:15.653
Kostantino: Right? So.

151
00:21:18.914 --> 00:21:22.883
Kostantino: yeah, very interesting scaling. The responsiveness seems to

152
00:21:23.264 --> 00:21:26.773
Kostantino: to disappear. If I get too far

153
00:21:27.014 --> 00:21:43.064
Kostantino: magnified. If my command plus prompts move towards higher levels of magnification. The responsiveness of it is a little bit choppy, and that means that I'm not going to get the level of magnification that I need to be able to read things quickly.

154
00:21:43.174 --> 00:21:49.913
Kostantino: It's easier to see that there's 2 tabs dashboard and courses. I'm going to quickly get up here

155
00:21:50.354 --> 00:21:53.644
Kostantino: and see if I can come back up to

156
00:21:53.934 --> 00:21:55.604
Kostantino: the Hamburger

157
00:21:56.984 --> 00:21:58.104
here.

158
00:22:00.104 --> 00:22:10.264
Kostantino: So it looks like once I select the Hamburger. Everything on the right hand side also disappears. So

159
00:22:12.054 --> 00:22:13.004
Kostantino: oh.

160
00:22:14.894 --> 00:22:21.774
Kostantino: so now in the Hamburger. we have got 4 elements. And

161
00:22:25.024 --> 00:22:27.044
Kostantino: see, I'm just

162
00:22:27.774 --> 00:22:32.503
Kostantino: okay. Dashboard courses, preferences. Logo.

163
00:22:32.884 --> 00:22:36.954
Kostantino: Okay? So what happened then?

164
00:22:37.584 --> 00:22:40.904
Kostantino:  2.

165
00:22:41.124 --> 00:22:46.803
Kostantino: All of this are on the left.

166
00:22:48.054 --> 00:22:56.564
Kostantino: Only way I'm gonna be able to try and see any of that is with Pinch to zoom. Because if I'm using my command, plus

167
00:22:56.974 --> 00:23:07.553
Kostantino: that was one click from where I was one click back. I now see this left navigation menu definitely needs some attention paid to that.

168
00:23:08.234 --> 00:23:12.173
Kostantino:  This sense

169
00:23:13.124 --> 00:23:16.083
Kostantino: was horses, which was kind of queenish.

170
00:23:17.934 --> 00:23:19.693
Kostantino: See? I can't

171
00:23:20.424 --> 00:23:25.173
Kostantino: really can't get there with just the pinch to zoom.

172
00:23:28.144 --> 00:23:32.744
Kostantino: Well, there's the beta again. I think my accessibility journey. Maybe.

173
00:23:33.194 --> 00:23:36.723
Kostantino:  take the course.

174
00:23:37.904 --> 00:23:44.883
Kostantino: Can't really see. I'm gonna assume that that looks like the combination of grays that I saw in the circle.

175
00:23:45.774 --> 00:23:53.803
Kostantino:  bookmarks. Okay? So I'm gonna come back here.

176
00:23:54.874 --> 00:24:01.754
Kostantino: Try and get to the singular column back up here. And

177
00:24:02.964 --> 00:24:10.304
Kostantino: yeah, these are just the 4 that we saw earlier dashboard forces, preferences and log out right? So

178
00:24:10.344 --> 00:24:18.413
Kostantino: everything that's on the left over there that I'm supposed to be looking at like my bookmarks and whatnot

179
00:24:18.554 --> 00:24:35.134
Kostantino: is not accessible under certain magnification, so that would definitely create some challenges for me. What I really do like again, is the simplicity I like being able to come into a particular course.

180
00:24:35.174 --> 00:24:38.864
Kostantino: I know that I am actionable.

181
00:24:38.954 --> 00:24:49.563
Kostantino: Oh, okay, I thought that some of the links were disabled, but it looks like I've now gotten into the course. which is kind of cool.

182
00:24:52.294 --> 00:24:56.204
Kostantino: What I'm going to try and do is

183
00:24:56.614 --> 00:24:58.334
very quickly.

184
00:25:00.444 --> 00:25:03.463
Kostantino: Oh. bear with me here.

185
00:25:07.874 --> 00:25:16.053
Kostantino: just using my option. Command 8. All I can really see is the tip of my arrow

186
00:25:17.144 --> 00:25:31.964
Kostantino: zoom. Apple changed these just a month or so ago. Follow over. So now I've enabled my Hubber text. Now, what that is going to allow me to do is try and quickly

187
00:25:32.264 --> 00:25:44.903
Kostantino: navigate around and start to use my hover text. you will see that my hover text setting which engages when there is a mouse over, and I hold down command

188
00:25:45.024 --> 00:25:47.914
Kostantino: populates a

189
00:25:48.464 --> 00:25:53.214
Kostantino: what you see as a bright yellow background with black text.

190
00:25:53.254 --> 00:26:13.354
Kostantino: For me it is a dark blue with a bright pink outline. The Times, New Roman font is a bright white, and that is set at 228 pixels or points. And if you compare that to 12 points, it's a factor of 19 or around 1,900%.

191
00:26:13.364 --> 00:26:23.173
Kostantino: So when we talk about Wicc and the minimum requirements for 200 magnification and responsive design and and whatnot.

192
00:26:23.594 --> 00:26:25.104
Kostantino: I'm well past that

193
00:26:25.384 --> 00:26:33.693
Kostantino:  the big issue that happens a lot with hover text is, once you go

194
00:26:33.704 --> 00:26:43.734
Kostantino: past a word that might have 5, 6, or 7 characters in it, and you've got 2 words or a longer word. It doesn't

195
00:26:44.134 --> 00:26:48.503
Kostantino: respond. The way that hover text should.

196
00:26:48.594 --> 00:26:54.343
Kostantino: I can see at the bottom here in a kind of pencil eraser, pink

197
00:26:54.374 --> 00:27:02.133
Kostantino: a link that would take me somewhere. I can see that that's actionable by the color contrast.

198
00:27:02.144 --> 00:27:06.054
Kostantino: What I can't see is the start of the content.

199
00:27:06.154 --> 00:27:12.924
Kostantino: So what I have to do is I have to stay perfectly still over that area

200
00:27:12.964 --> 00:27:15.693
Kostantino: and then start to scroll up.

201
00:27:15.744 --> 00:27:20.183
Kostantino: to start to get to the top of the content.

202
00:27:20.204 --> 00:27:32.793
Kostantino: What happens is, I then have to now go down. and sometimes words don't fit properly. I know that this word is introduction, but there's no N on the end of it.

203
00:27:32.924 --> 00:27:44.583
Kostantino: All of the content is probably gonna do this, which means that all of this content could be very quickly fixed. It's not a difficult fix to address the way that hover text

204
00:27:44.624 --> 00:27:45.724
Kostantino: scrolls.

205
00:27:45.794 --> 00:28:06.663
Kostantino: And it's really not the end of the world. But it is the end of the world when you're dealing with an enormous amount of content on a site, and you have to keep on starting at the bottom, scrolling up to the top and then going down to the bottom. Very bad. Ux, and it really doesn't help me understand that content that much.

206
00:28:07.114 --> 00:28:14.823
Kostantino: We have no hover text over any of the image. I'm hoping that all text would be there. I'm sure that it would.

207
00:28:15.914 --> 00:28:20.994
Kostantino: It's our progress bar. So now I think that I can appreciate.

208
00:28:22.364 --> 00:28:32.744
Kostantino: let's have a look at it. So if I see a very horizontal long bar like that. That should be my progress bar. So command minus to come out.

209
00:28:33.984 --> 00:28:41.483
Kostantino: I do have a responsive button there. like the fact that the text is white in there at least.

210
00:28:41.914 --> 00:28:46.173
Kostantino:  We've got

211
00:28:46.664 --> 00:28:49.054
Kostantino: number of things down here

212
00:28:52.084 --> 00:28:55.164
way too much gray content

213
00:28:55.764 --> 00:29:10.423
Kostantino: over here. It's discoverable with hover text, but gray on black, grey, on white. Never a good thing. Always very difficult to deal with, and most of the time I'm just resorting to my upper text.

214
00:29:10.754 --> 00:29:12.203
Kostantino: Looks like we've got

215
00:29:12.724 --> 00:29:16.394
Kostantino: some kind of button here that sounds available

216
00:29:18.294 --> 00:29:27.223
Kostantino: all right. You can see that I'm moving my mouse, but you can also see now that hover text and the touch points the touch.

217
00:29:27.364 --> 00:29:34.884
Kostantino: Is not scaling properly. Looks like the button is now over the digital accessibility section.

218
00:29:35.154 --> 00:29:42.043
Kostantino:  down here. We've got the pencil eraser pink. Now you're seeing what happens a lot

219
00:29:42.384 --> 00:29:52.004
Kostantino: right if I'm trying to do this quicker, and I quickly scroll too much, while now I've over scrolled, and now I have to try and find my page

220
00:29:52.044 --> 00:30:02.594
Kostantino: placement again. which means that I have to. and out of that magnification start up at the top. There was the learning button

221
00:30:04.684 --> 00:30:05.564
Kostantino: and

222
00:30:06.724 --> 00:30:13.423
Kostantino: both the introductory courses. So that looks like we've got a whole bunch of

223
00:30:16.594 --> 00:30:22.713
Kostantino: alright. Why are there? Why is there some white screen readers.

224
00:30:25.424 --> 00:30:32.304
Kostantino: Okay. if we have 2 different titles or 2 different sections in this particular course.

225
00:30:32.644 --> 00:30:46.314
Kostantino: we should really deal with more of the other elements of contrast. So about digital accessibility. And further down, screen readers. that text could definitely be bigger and bolder

226
00:30:46.634 --> 00:30:59.004
Kostantino: when we say, contrast too often contrast is considered just the color contrast when the definition of contrast really deals with the juxtaposition of 2 or more elements or considerations

227
00:30:59.014 --> 00:31:09.403
Kostantino: being compared against each other. So in this particular case, I'd like to see more line spacing character, spacing, word, spacing.

228
00:31:09.534 --> 00:31:18.633
Kostantino: font, selection, font, size, boldness, weight, italics. There's a lot more to contrast than just color. So

229
00:31:18.684 --> 00:31:23.214
really making a point of helping me understand that those are

230
00:31:23.304 --> 00:31:24.784
Kostantino: 2 sections.

231
00:31:26.064 --> 00:31:34.033
Kostantino: Now, you can see why I'm going to get out of that configuration because there's just too much to try and get around

232
00:31:34.194 --> 00:31:39.433
Kostantino: if I'm using my tab ability, I can see that

233
00:31:39.654 --> 00:31:43.813
Kostantino: I have that kind of mustardy, yellowish

234
00:31:44.504 --> 00:31:46.224
Kostantino: green if you want

235
00:31:46.344 --> 00:31:49.393
Kostantino:  which is great.

236
00:31:52.054 --> 00:32:01.084
Kostantino: I really like the fact that there's not an enormous amount of content that's forcing you to have to cycle through your tab key.

237
00:32:01.264 --> 00:32:05.333
Kostantino: And now shift tab back. which is great.

238
00:32:08.474 --> 00:32:23.044
Kostantino: So it looks like we've got what I think was activity. I think on the right hand side I saw the word status which would tell me like how far I'm going into each one of these. I'm just gonna randomly pick

239
00:32:23.544 --> 00:32:33.824
Kostantino: start learning so that we could start at the beginning. Something is happening. There's some kind of oh. okay.

240
00:32:34.384 --> 00:32:36.544
Kostantino: one zone. So

241
00:32:37.664 --> 00:32:41.824
Kostantino: it looks like we are in the course

242
00:32:42.274 --> 00:32:45.284
Kostantino:  going to.

243
00:32:46.434 --> 00:32:49.434
Kostantino: I'm back to my single layout

244
00:32:49.644 --> 00:32:52.973
Kostantino: because I saw a whole bunch of colors there.

245
00:32:53.994 --> 00:32:55.773
Kostantino: now, you can see

246
00:32:56.404 --> 00:32:59.343
Kostantino: I will be able to

247
00:33:00.684 --> 00:33:01.764
Kostantino: boat

248
00:33:04.744 --> 00:33:15.293
Kostantino: alright. So we have a hover state change over each of these links. But I don't really see any type of focus indicator other than my hover state. That's telling me.

249
00:33:15.434 --> 00:33:23.554
Kostantino: Ideally. Why wouldn't we change those colors? You know, for instance, right now it's that greenish, yellowish

250
00:33:23.674 --> 00:33:35.194
Kostantino:  why wouldn't we turn it into a bright pink or a bright orange when I hover over it? Maybe those colors change when I actually engage with it.

251
00:33:35.674 --> 00:33:38.294
Kostantino:  so

252
00:33:40.124 --> 00:33:47.393
Kostantino: I am now in a part that I think says or should say, meet your instructor.

253
00:33:50.514 --> 00:33:52.034
Kostantino: It's building

254
00:33:53.874 --> 00:33:56.814
Kostantino: course. Don't mind.

255
00:34:02.914 --> 00:34:04.424
Kostantino: Oh, little bit.

256
00:34:07.363 --> 00:34:15.554
Kostantino: I would typically have some challenges with this black on this kind of mustardy green. yellow.

257
00:34:16.714 --> 00:34:28.423
Kostantino: Okay, so here's a challenge. I am scrolling right to left, so that I could try and get over and quote unquote, meet my instructor. But I can't seem to do that

258
00:34:31.343 --> 00:34:36.233
Kostantino: now. It looks like we have the video play option here.

259
00:34:37.484 --> 00:34:44.143
Kostantino: Yeah, it's not scaling. The responsiveness of it is definitely a challenge.

260
00:34:44.244 --> 00:34:46.514
Kostantino: Excuse me for that hip-hop.

261
00:34:47.304 --> 00:34:50.633
Kostantino:  I'm gonna come back.

262
00:34:52.883 --> 00:34:54.634
Try and

263
00:34:58.564 --> 00:35:00.494
Kostantino: meet your instructor.

264
00:35:05.154 --> 00:35:12.593
Kostantino: I'm Kate. Oh, Kate Kalsavets, Hello, Kate, good to see you hopefully.

265
00:35:13.374 --> 00:35:16.034
Kostantino: okay. So here's our video.

266
00:35:17.344 --> 00:35:24.454
Kostantino: I think that says, Oh, probably. Say, I think I saw the word meet. So meet my instructor right?

267
00:35:24.964 --> 00:35:30.503
Kostantino:  Now, what I know from some of our upscale training is that

268
00:35:30.914 --> 00:35:36.624
Kostantino: we have the option to deal with descriptions.

269
00:35:37.504 --> 00:35:42.144
Kostantino: And then we have the video transcript, which is great, fantastic.

270
00:35:42.684 --> 00:35:47.843
Kostantino: So I'm gonna try and come back to the single.

271
00:35:50.044 --> 00:35:56.133
Kostantino: All right. Okay, I was really worried that some of that responsiveness was not kicking in.

272
00:35:56.174 --> 00:36:08.663
Kostantino: But Comichiwa, it has definitely kicked in here. So you can see my comfort level with this single format orientation.

273
00:36:08.994 --> 00:36:11.934
Kostantino: I really really like it. And

274
00:36:11.984 --> 00:36:26.073
Kostantino: here is where we would be able to go through all of the elements. I'd be able to come down. I like the fact that I can. That's great. I could just touch anywhere on the screen to stop and start

275
00:36:26.084 --> 00:36:39.094
Kostantino: I'm gonna have the same problem with the video that I mentioned earlier with the icons. It's very, very bright. Just gonna quickly command control option. 8 out

276
00:36:39.174 --> 00:36:40.214
again.

277
00:36:40.224 --> 00:36:42.314
Kostantino: We've got that same problem.

278
00:36:42.374 --> 00:36:43.464
Kostantino: So

279
00:36:43.504 --> 00:36:50.744
Kostantino: when I come out of it, it's a bright white when I'm in it. And I started

280
00:36:50.954 --> 00:37:03.583
Kostantino: going past that first black screen once I get into any part of the content, or it starts the entire back part of the screen right now for me is a bright, bright, bright, bright, bright, bright white, with, I think, some

281
00:37:03.844 --> 00:37:06.904
Kostantino: red text on there

282
00:37:07.114 --> 00:37:22.463
Kostantino: can can deal with it. The good part for me is that you know as much as I'd love to see the lovely and amazingly talented Kate. I'm more about the content, so it would be more about listening to what's going on.

283
00:37:22.664 --> 00:37:39.923
Kostantino: I also am a very big note taker, and as a result of those notes being able to quickly come back into my browser and touching anywhere on the video allows me to stop it so that I can quickly do what I want with my notes and then go back to it.

284
00:37:40.144 --> 00:37:51.804
Kostantino: If I really wanted to take my time and and and absorb all of the content. Make sure that I don't miss a word. I would definitely go down to the video transcript side of things.

285
00:37:51.844 --> 00:37:53.574
Kostantino: So,

286
00:37:54.344 --> 00:38:00.224
Kostantino: what is a challenge is that you have to be directly over that element?

287
00:38:00.794 --> 00:38:08.084
Kostantino:  So I'm gonna tell you as the learning manager.

288
00:38:08.894 --> 00:38:22.973
Kostantino: I'm impressed, and I think that this is the kind of flow that we would be going for or through. I could probably go back to the other courses and try and determine some items.

289
00:38:23.254 --> 00:38:37.764
Kostantino: But our biggest issues were really some of the map bars or the sidebar that we had where that content was disappearing once we were using the command plus minus keys. If we were using pinch to zoom.

290
00:38:37.774 --> 00:38:42.714
Kostantino: we didn't have a change if I used my option, command 8.

291
00:38:42.754 --> 00:39:04.403
Kostantino: I didn't have a change, but because I was magnified at at such a high level, much more difficult to try and navigate through. Would this be a platform that I would like my team to work with 100? It is definitely

292
00:39:04.444 --> 00:39:23.244
Kostantino: the kind of layout and configuration that I think would help a lot of disabled users in my case with magnification. I do have the responsiveness with the Hover text, although, as I mentioned, it, has to start at the top and not at the bottom.

293
00:39:23.264 --> 00:39:28.584
Kostantino: I would also, in closing. suggest that

294
00:39:29.354 --> 00:39:34.393
Kostantino: if there is an option to put in maybe a

295
00:39:34.574 --> 00:39:35.664
Kostantino: simple

296
00:39:35.844 --> 00:39:48.134
Kostantino: setting within my preferences that would maybe remove some of the content that's not required and maybe simplify it to text. Only that would really help.

297
00:39:48.424 --> 00:39:58.083
Kostantino: I also happen to be a user that would be more than fine, with all black on all, or white or

298
00:39:58.224 --> 00:40:03.163
Kostantino: inverted for me all white on that black

299
00:40:03.184 --> 00:40:09.093
Kostantino: if those options existed, I would definitely be taking advantage of them overall. But

300
00:40:09.364 --> 00:40:15.574
Kostantino:  Being able to come back to  courses

301
00:40:15.994 --> 00:40:17.134
Kostantino: hopefully.

302
00:40:17.394 --> 00:40:31.564
Kostantino: Oh, I don't know. Okay, there we are. So we're back to the landing page. Really nice, simple navigation menu up top. I'd like to see courses in front of dashboard for alphabetical and logical reasons.

303
00:40:31.734 --> 00:40:38.924
Kostantino: got a hamburger that transforms over on the right for the user and the pulldown for preferences settings.

304
00:40:38.984 --> 00:40:49.813
Kostantino: but the active courses, the journey, and then the bookmarks. All of that section tends to disappear at this level. And I'm just gonna go in

305
00:40:49.944 --> 00:40:51.814
Kostantino: one last time.

306
00:40:56.874 --> 00:41:10.684
Kostantino: Yeah, it seems to have gone for me. I could spend a little bit of time trying to look at it. But II think that's I think that's what happened. So is it usable and understandable

307
00:41:10.974 --> 00:41:20.154
Kostantino: absolutely? Are there a couple of small issues that I think are. you know, potentially larger issues, but not monstrous.

308
00:41:20.244 --> 00:41:22.673
Kostantino: and their relatively quick fixes.

309
00:41:22.804 --> 00:41:35.034
Kostantino:  what are my aus thoughts on this? It probably gonna be pretty hot because fable has done a great job here on the upscale side of things.

310
00:41:35.064 --> 00:41:49.893
Kostantino: of simplifying things, of really providing a user with the options that make sense. And everything did seem to make sense for me, except for some of the issues that I pointed out. So

311
00:41:50.294 --> 00:41:51.494
Kostantino: with that

312
00:41:51.584 --> 00:42:07.154
Kostantino: I would say, thank you so much, fable for giving me the opportunity to provide some of my feedback and my lived experience and trying to navigate the upscale side or this new Qa version of it

313
00:42:07.444 --> 00:42:14.874
Kostantino: and thank you for doing everything that you do typically with clients. I would thank them for working for us

314
00:42:14.974 --> 00:42:22.564
Kostantino: or with us. but in my case I have to thank fable for working for the entire disabled community.

315
00:42:22.654 --> 00:42:44.983
Kostantino: What you do and how you do it is absolutely incredible, and I have an enormous amount of pride and joy. Being part of the fable, team and family that is making accessibility happen for millions of people around the world. Keep up the great work, and have yourself a great day.
