47
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.900
Dis: Is that the last one I need to do? Yep. I can't.

48
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:54.700
Dis:  I don't know what this. Maybe there's some missing content there. But okay, about the engineering course laptops with split screen view codes.

49
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.089
Dis: Yeah, we'll come to accessibility engineering course.

50
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.669

59
00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:15.639

60
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:29.200
Dis: I just want to read this real quick. So it's really champions at this level baseline. Now, which about digital accessibility and assistive technology have a strong desire to learn more about how they make and make actions

61
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.640
Dis: accessible products.

62
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.039
Dis: Okay? And then

63
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:44.599
Dis: here's my badge and a download button is here. Yeah, I mean overall it.

64
00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:49.809
Dis: It fits within my screen notification. I can't complain about the

65
00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.020
Dis: about the way it looks. I'm just zooming in a bit more the

66
00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.800
Dis: just trying to see.

67
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:02.700
Dis: So around like.

68
00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.820
Dis: let's see, what is this? 500?

69
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.500
Dis: You could see a little bit that the image here gets a little bit blurry.

70
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.789
Dis: and the thought so maybe something to work on to get higher resolution.

71
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:21.500
Dis: badge And

72
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:30.129
Dis: I don't know if it's just me could be me. But to download text is

73
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:34.260
Dis: a bit blurry at 500. Magnificent.

74
00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.689
Dis:  I think that's just something to take a look at.

75
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:46.610
Dis: Yeah. But overall everything else looks pretty good. I'm gonna check out the level 2 here.

76
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.560
Dis: download badge. Yeah.

77
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:59.040
Dis: And new levels coming soon. Got it?

78
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:00.010
Dis: Great?

79
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:10.740
Dis: Well. yeah, I think overall. Everything fits within my screen. Magnification

80
00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:19.750
Dis: things are easy to find always have been on vapable site. So I will. The only thing I would say, is the font on the

81
00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:29.589
Dis: on here is a bit blurry. So getting a higher resolution badge, I think, could help

82
00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:38.489
Dis: with that. because I thought it was my eyeball, but I had to check again. And it it's not so.

83
00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:42.779
Dis: It's actually blurry at 500 magnification.

84
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:47.450
Dis: So well. I think. and the other thing is

85
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:57.540
Dis:  I think getting to here and doing the introduction to accessibility. This Gorm course was a fairly simple

86
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:12.329
Dis:  Everything was scaled well and intuitive. I didn't have a hard time like I didn't have to think about where certain butting layout layouts were on like for some sites.

87
00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:17.069
Dis: So I do appreciate how fable is consistently thinking about.

88
00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:24.320
Dis: you know, people with with disabilities accessing their site and also their courses.

89
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.950
So thank you so much for listening.
