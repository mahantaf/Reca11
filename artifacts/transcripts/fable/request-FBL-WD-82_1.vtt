191
00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:37.350
Kristen: navigating by using landmarks or regions. Do you ever navigate that way, or do you just use headings?

233
00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:10.589
Kristen: focus on going through a few different things, because this is the only one, I think, that has a search

234
00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.229
Kristen: field. So

235
00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:13.549
Kristen: um,

236
00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:20.789

00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:47.109
Kristen: Okay. So I'm Gaza and I'm using jaws, screen Screen reader software. And right now i'm using

241
00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:54.179
Geza: Microsoft Edge and i'm using windows eleven as the operating system. So

242
00:35:54.540 --> 00:36:00.739
Geza: right on the top of the page, and I'm going to check out the headings first

243
00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:15.089

Kristen: Awesome. Thank you.

248
00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:52.540
Kristen: Um. The one other thing, like some people use this thing called regions to navigate for pages, so it kind of jumps people from

249
00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:57.629
Kristen: it'll usually, if it's coded properly, it should start at the heading,

250
00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:07.970
Kristen: and then it will go to like the main content section, and then the footer. Have you ever navigated using the regions like that?

251
00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:11.689
Geza: The agents? So I have differential properties

252
00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:21.280

Kristen: Okay?

263
00:38:54.400 --> 00:39:04.089
Kristen: So when you were just doing that, was it? Is it like automatically reading out everything else that's like underneath each of the regions? No, it just jumps there.

264
00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:16.109
Geza: Skip the made content. Same page link. No, it's a but it doesn't automate the

265
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:27.239
Kristen: it's got to make content, namely, I have to press. Ah use ah donkey! And a sort of the same page like sip domain content like graphics label that's what i'm saying, I don't like that for you.

266
00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:56.070
Geza: We learn with an application region, and as a

267
00:39:56.430 --> 00:40:01.539
done cursor in some time. Cursor it's, and then it's sorted to be

268
00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:02.839
Kristen: okay.

269
00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:12.890
Kristen: So if you just press the letter queue. Will it go through and just the name? It just will just go through the regions. But it doesn't start to anything by himself. No,

270
00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:24.320
Kristen: okay. Do you want to show me how that works from the top? Just just only like going through the regions like I think it had. Um, there's like a breadcrumb one or something like that.

271
00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:28.639
Geza: So right on the top of the page. So the first region

272
00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:36.020

Kristen: with the core like a green miller

324
00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:36.899
Kristen: before you searched. There was, I think, about five or six different like project cards, I guess, like in this list, and when you searched accessible Now, there's now there's just two, and it's only the ones that have

325
00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:41.889
Kristen: accessible university. It's kind of a fleet that they made up

326
00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:49.269
Kristen: it wasn't heading level freely right at the top table that wrap into the bottom, but lightly accessible, and there was any other

327
00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:51.399
Kristen: like it did work, but it didn't

00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:53.590
Kristen: notification.

329
00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:57.859

330
00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:02.690
Geza: Yeah, Yeah, because it it didn't jump anywhere.

331
00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:10.370
Applied to accessible university heading applied to accessible pro at your request-standing level, to apply to accessibility project and automations and in search requested to access the virtual pc cursor the

332
00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:15.390
Geza: apply to accessible university setting level three layers, adding that freely applied to accessible university, the

333
00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:28.890

But why is it accessible University setting level for applied to accessible university, but rapidly the top level leveling level project overview members getting located on the project or applied to accessible universal flight to accessible university, and the like to accept in progress with the four, like a three meters

334
00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:50.660

Kristen: He's.

336
00:48:53.110 --> 00:48:55.889
Kristen: Okay, Yeah, that makes sense, because there's two different

00:48:55.900 --> 00:49:04.669
Kristen: like sections, I guess, on on the list. There's the filters button. Do you want to? Maybe open that

341
00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:40.880
that's a

342
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:49.189
cancel check completed, completed, scheduled, scheduled in progress and progress Checkouts not submitted so middle check out draft, wrap, Checkmark's notion brooks on status wrap, check out the

343
00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:52.489

344
00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:54.690
Kristen: no, I don't think it. It doesn't matter. Just

345
00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:57.190
Kristen: web check outs not yet. Space at the desk.

346
00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:06.189
Geza: Replicate objects, rafts or military carts and objects.

347
00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:07.109
Kristen: Yeah.

348
00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:15.399
Kristen: And progress scheduled scheduled to complete cancel Cancels unsuccessful check out, and success providers for compatibility test checkpoints not yet compatibility, or in the user interview applied filter button.

349
00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:23.760
Geza: So and then Here is the bottom, it says, Apply filters, and for main region filter, but is filtering by, wrapped, submitted in progress, filtering by rap to submit it in progress

350
00:50:23.770 --> 00:50:38.890
filter button filtering by graph to submit it and program with the four right screen meter, laptop, slash, desktop windows, and media listen wisdom to like the cable demo, five, August, thirty, first, twenty, twenty, two, one, thirty, two, P. M. We send maintenance and main region and main region and maintenance. There are no headings on this stage

351
00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:48.670
there are no, and there are no headings on this day. Main read list and August for a table. That list of can listen, and media with those laptops screen read with the four items filtering by graph submitted in progress with the four items filtering filter button,

352
00:50:49.660 --> 00:51:05.969
Geza: which will be open. The same list of free uploading dashboards, linked to the linkedin list of two by the link, like projects, and it contains virtual these filters button filtering by with the for like screen meter, laptop, select desktop windows and media. Listen. Listen to light on table, Demo five, August, thirty, first, two thousand and twenty, two, one, thirty, two, P. M. Labeled with the weekend.

353
00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:13.469
Geza: There are no settings on this page but it doesn't slows up as a heading, and with the laptops left. That stream is before I filter in my wrap to submit it with a four like three meter.

354
00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:27.939
Kristen: Is Is it like I noticed it said. There is no headings on the page.

355
00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:29.390
Kristen: Okay,

356
00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:32.890
Geza: but it it No, it doesn't shows up the headings, but

357
00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:45.719
Geza: it's also like on cable Level five. Also to with that mediate with those laptops with that, and then with the laptop screen release of four items, three meter

358
00:51:45.730 --> 00:52:00.400
Kristen: with the four I filtering by grab to submit it in progress with the four items

359
00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:05.029
Kristen: List of stable Demo five.

360
00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:12.400
Kristen: I wonder why that's happening? Because there's also there's something that says apply to accessible university. And it was a heading

361
00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:15.490
Kristen: two, I think, on the other.

362
00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:17.419
Kristen: Yes, yes, on the yes.

363
00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:19.290
Kristen: But it's not happening on here.

364
00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:41.180
Geza: No, no. So what's going on, you know, like like Sometimes, if you don't going on the list, I have to use differential properties for the list. Short of it. It is Letter L. Right at the top with a different if chosen in this, and if it's choose up in headings, I have to use the letter age, so I have to use different different

365
00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:42.489
Geza: a shortcut keys,

366
00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:59.790
Kristen: but actually some some uh search engine is. It is the same. Sometimes some search. As soon as it's so generous it shows up. At least some of them show, but most of them they shows up in heading some of them. They shows just this right. What do you prefer like, Would you rather

367
00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:16.989
Geza: me person? I like the heading more? Because when it's heading I can, I can go by heading by heading by the heading. But if it's at least no problem with the But I have to have a little bit more, so I have to use the

368
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.390
Kristen: all right, right,

369
00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:25.969
Geza: So that that's the So it is when it's list. I have to read even the details.

370
00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:29.089
Geza: If you choose. Headings, it's faster. But

371
00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:44.420
Kristen: right, okay, Do you want to, since we're talking with the headings now, and this page is maybe a little bit messed out of. Now, do you want to start at the top of this and then go through.

372
00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:48.590
Kristen: So it has no headaches on this page. There are no headaches on this page. It's not the same page.

373
00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:51.390
Kristen: Oh, weird. Okay. So once

374
00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:53.390
Kristen: when you apply the filters.

375
00:53:53.400 --> 00:54:02.190
Kristen: Yes, Now suddenly, there's no headings like the page itself. Hasn't hasn't like visually changed much for me.

376
00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:03.290
Kristen: It's all.

377
00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:05.409
Kristen: Yeah, I don't know what's going on there.

378
00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:08.090
So So what's going on? If I press and the letter that

379
00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:19.620
Kristen: with the free items

380
00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:25.889
Geza: with the four items: Screen reader, laptop, slash windows and media with a list of two items wrapping the top list of three items.

381
00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:34.089
Geza: That's the different. But in this end heading. See, I have to you. I have to read the more of the details because it's list.

382
00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:35.060
Kristen: Right?

383
00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:47.789
Kristen: Okay, Wow. I'm surprised that it doesn't still have headings on this page

384
00:54:47.800 --> 00:55:01.689
Geza: open's new tab,

385
00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:04.469
Geza: stable demo label, jump to line, dialogue to escape

386
00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:08.990
Geza: cable demo, adding level. One project overview, adding left cable demo editing, list

387
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:15.390
the label Demo Label labeled it as a

388
00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:50.890
Screen Reader Research. We're able to be wrapped in the top. Catherine Button collapsed, and Members Button Hilder button. Search, but I know setting level really applied to excessive in progress at a level really applied to accessible in the learning progress of four items.

389
00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:54.520
Geza: You know what happened when I refresh it, it's totally take out the futures.

390
00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:57.189
Geza: See

391
00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:58.970
Kristen: the

392
00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:01.689
Kristen: so it's really interesting.

393
00:56:02.290 --> 00:56:09.239
Geza: So you know what I mean like, because I differ at the page. So I I think it meant event back to the default.

394
00:56:10.030 --> 00:56:23.510
Kristen: Yeah. So I wonder if that's a problem with the filter function, because it should be letting you use the headings to navigate once you use the filters, but it's not doing that, and you have to go through it by a list

395
00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:38.909
Kristen: I this. Yes, okay, wow, Okay, interesting. That's really good. I I will put that in in the video clips that i'm making, because I you probably want to know about that.

396
00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:42.609
Kristen: I

397
00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:49.189
Kristen: let me just double-check my email notes. So sure, of course, I just want to make sure that I have everything that

398
00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:52.000
Kristen: we need.

399
00:56:56.130 --> 00:57:03.490
Kristen: Have you had any any problems with any of the fable websites or apps or no? No, that's good.

400
00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:08.990
Geza: And many times I'm. Using freeball website and my platform. I never had any problem. No, no,

401
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.229
Kristen: that's great.

402
00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:26.850
Geza: Sometimes it once or pass it past connection problem, but it's not related to the maps at it positive I would say like maybe zoom

403
00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:41.270
Geza: or something, but but not uh the website. Do not find one time I do. I had to set the the time, but also I could manage it that wasn't a problem. So I never had this very, very serious problem or something.

404
00:57:51.890 --> 00:58:00.830
Kristen: Okay, what? So thinking about like other websites that you have had issues with. What do you think is like

405
00:58:00.860 --> 00:58:30.229
Kristen: Some of the worst, like the things that are the causing most headaches for you to like. Do some website, if it's very, very graphical if it doesn't set the graphics for if I can, if I can, My! Because it could be that it like in navigational, graphic, or just a graphic? It could it? Could. It could cause more problem because I don't know, like what is on the on the graphics. But, for example, if there is a video one, it doesn't

406
00:58:39.970 --> 00:58:59.049
Geza: it doesn't say anything I don't even know, like like what's going on, and sometimes it more like when it's a it. It will embed it in the website, and I go to the website. I don't think I know It's not that. Okay, just jumping with my? So I know some something is wrong, right because because of the website,

407
00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:26.150
Kristen: so it it could be like that. But, uh, those, those on my my major concern. The other things are are pretty good, so if I can read the headings the least uh different links. If there is no broken link that that's okay. So. But if it's not labeled, But if it's not labeled, But if it's not labeled that that could be a problem. I don't know It's a navigation button or something else,

408
00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:27.660
Kristen: right? Right?

409
00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:53.289
Kristen: So, having the buttons feel like properly. Okay, I guess that's very important, because if it's, if it's navigation, it's just play, or something, or or jaunty, or forward, or backward. Yes, it it could be if it if I don't know what is on the lab, but because if it doesn't say anything, it just says,

410
00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:58.120
Kristen: All right. I don't know what you're clicking on. They're agreeing to.

411
00:59:58.130 --> 01:00:00.580
Kristen: Yeah, that's the problem. Hmm.

412
01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:13.820
Kristen: Okay, I don't think that I have anything else that we need to go through. I think it was just headings and doing a search.

413
01:00:14.070 --> 01:00:27.170
Kristen: I mean, the search is working what except, you know like when So that's a different, you know. But i'm using the when I when I apply the filters, it shows least that's it right. So

414
01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:33.480
Geza: if I refresh it right, it goes back to the depos, so I I have to set it up the filters again.

415
01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:35.649
Kristen: Yes.

416
01:00:35.830 --> 01:00:37.479
Kristen: Yeah. Okay,

417
01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:38.589
Kristen: yeah,

418
01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:42.960
Kristen M: I will put that. We'll definitely put that in the video That's Uh:

419
01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:46.220
Kristen: interesting to go through

420
01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:11.439
Kristen: the

421
01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:12.779
Kristen: he's.

422
01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:14.350
Kristen: Well, that's good.

423
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:18.399
Kristen: Okay.

424
01:01:18.410 --> 01:01:23.590
Kristen: Thank you very much. This has been super helpful, and

425
01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.290
Kristen: it's a good experience.

426
01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:35.489
Kristen: Nice! How long have you been working this able?

427
01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:39.690
Kristen: And she's two thousand and eighteen. Oh, wow, long time

428
01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:43.529
Kristen: Long time. Yeah, Yeah, It's It's like four years. Yeah,

429
01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:46.390
I was there from the beginning. So

430
01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:50.690
Kristen: right yeah, I was gonna say It's a pretty. It's a pretty new company. So

431
01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:53.490
Kristen: that's really cool.

432
01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:55.489
Geza: But I like it. It's it's

433
01:01:55.500 --> 01:02:02.690
Geza: It's It's so. Some something something something different, and especially we can work. So that's one of one.

434
01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:15.869
Kristen: Yes. Well, that's really good. I just started, and I guess at the end of June I've been making a few different demo videos here and there a lot of like mobile phone app

435
01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:22.780
Kristen: testing and stuff like that. But they asked if I wanted to do some user interviews and start

436
01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:25.589
Kristen: working on videos with other people, and I was like,

437
01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:28.439
Kristen: Yes,

438
01:02:28.450 --> 01:02:48.250
Geza: It's it's awesome. I I have. Also, I have a iphone. I'm using iphone. But the other thing, you know, like um, the iphone is is different, but I also. But my computers are all of them are windows right, but I don't have android iphone just I for

439
01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:58.290
Kristen: right. So do you use voiceover for the iphone,

440
01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:20.839
Kristen: you and and and of course the main thing is voice over. Yes,

441
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:22.069
Kristen: thanks,

442
01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:23.540
Kristen: do you? Uh,

443
01:03:23.950 --> 01:03:28.789
Kristen: uh! Is there like a lot of differences between voice over and jaws? For?

444
01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:48.719
Kristen: Oh, totally different. Yes, definitely so. Uh, most of it is much easier to use. And uh, so i'm using it uh with the finger gestures. But the jaws is story, so we can't use jaws as the gestures we've just we have to use for the cable, and for the short pockets

445
01:03:48.730 --> 01:03:58.939
Kristen: it's totally totally different, and sometimes that's like for the tables we have to use like one to three for four or five fingers at the same time.

446
01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:06.069
Kristen: So you know, like like a when I'm using the iphone is totally different. Is one one fingers, two fingers.

447
01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:22.889
Kristen M: Wow: Yeah. Using five different fingers for tables, you said,

448
01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:36.590
Kristen: Yeah, yeah, for example, I have to use all control, right? So you know what I mean with tables I have. Both of my my hands are occupied,

449
01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:40.359
Kristen: so that on the phone is not like that. No, no,

450
01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:57.589
Kristen: right. Do you? Do you use your phone more than your laptop just for like kind of

451
01:05:12.770 --> 01:05:30.399
Kristen: i'm using phone. I just can the text, you know, like scale the or, for example, if I want to pick up some colors, even my my any kind of dress for my color, and then I also use the iphone. So the iphone it is for, for I would say like for everyday use,

452
01:05:30.410 --> 01:05:58.380
Kristen: right, for for example. And then I want to check out different scenarios, even on the street, or let's see, like if I just was someone and check out some something. I also use the iphone because I can make a picture, and then it says, What is what is on the scenery? See what is there, and then any kind of object, it can recognize the object. It's also very helpful if I want to to check a different Let's see, like

453
01:05:58.390 --> 01:06:07.790
Geza: the jars of can of different products. I also use the iphone for scanning. So so most of the time i'm using for everyday use the iphone.

454
01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:12.189
Kristen: Nice, do you? Is that an app like, do you seeing Ai or another?

455
01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:31.200
Kristen: Yes, yeah, yeah. And the that is the latest that it's called and visual is is much better than uh than I would say like uh uh, seeing that it's much more sophisticated. That's it like I would say, like there is like eight hundred different colors.

456
01:06:31.210 --> 01:06:32.589
Geza: It can recognize it

457
01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:34.790
nine hundred and eighty different colors.

458
01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:45.590
Kristen: Oh, wow! You know what I mean in and even for the subject Recognition, like the algorithms, are the I think, the All the the algorithms are more and more sophisticated.

459
01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:46.089
Kristen: Hey?

460
01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:48.519
Kristen: Okay, it's called and envisioned.

461
01:06:48.530 --> 01:06:55.619
Geza: Yes, and vision. And it is the free. Software And i'm gonna I don't want it from I from I'm using, but for I

462
01:06:55.630 --> 01:06:58.390
Kristen: nice Okay.

463
01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:14.060
Geza: But the envision actually it is uh the original. It is like it is a uh a a eyeglass, and then they can hook it up so. Any brand the the envision er

464
01:07:14.070 --> 01:07:19.990
eyeglass on when they turn their head. It says what is right in the area,

465
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:32.740
Kristen: What is in the area, right? So what what they did they have? They make this this software ambition for iphone use the

466
01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:40.490
Kristen: that's that's really good. I'm sure they did that for free. That's awesome, because I know that the glass things can be pretty expensive.

467
01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:43.589
Kristen: It's very expensive, because yes, yes,

468
01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:48.990
it's the same thing. So like the same idea, except, you know, like the form you you have to use this phone

469
01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:56.700
Geza: color scenery

470
01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:16.490
Kristen M: nice. I'm gonna download that and take a look at it because I used Ah, oh, it's probably like three years ago, or something. It's probably changed a lot since then. But I use the scene. One: Yeah, yes, yes,

471
01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:23.360
Kristen: it's more sophisticated. Thanks. I'm glad they're making better, more progress with stuff like that. It's good,

472
01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:25.190
Geza: much, much, much better,

473
01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:26.830
more sophisticated.

474
01:08:29.450 --> 01:08:32.960
Kristen: Okay, I'm going to download that and check it out after this.

475
01:08:34.609 --> 01:08:40.319
Kristen: Um, We are almost out of time. So

476
01:08:40.330 --> 01:08:49.090
Kristen: it's a pleasure. Thank you so much for sharing. Oh, you better, I hope I'm going to be sometimes in the future.

477
01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:55.489
Kristen: Yeah, yeah, I hope so. Hopefully, i'll be doing more user interviews, and it's been really

478
01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:56.569
Kristen: Yeah.

479
01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:08.890
Kristen: Well, I hope it not. It just started raining here, So maybe it's going to be Saturday or someday.

480
01:09:08.899 --> 01:09:10.289
It looks like, you know,

481
01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:13.489
but it's getting cooler every morning is cooler and cooler.

482
01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:26.690
Kristen: Yeah, in the mornings it's been cool. It's pretty hot here still in the afternoon's like in a weird, weird place in Caterbro. I feel like we we get the worst of the heat and the snow.

483
01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:42.119
Geza: I I used to race in Beta Guru I was. I was running that it was very early, and the one time I did the uh uh cycle increase. It was very heavy. So so I was there just to do different events. But I like,

484
01:09:42.130 --> 01:09:49.289
Kristen: Yeah, that's good. They've added a lot of different, like bike trails and and bike lanes and stuff, too. So that's been.

485
01:09:56.410 --> 01:10:01.490
Kristen: It was participated in several years ago in those events.

486
01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:07.719
Kristen: Oh, nice! That's good I did. We used to go to the Y and go swimming like twice a week.

487
01:10:07.730 --> 01:10:15.990
Kristen: Yeah, it's for for the pandemic, but it should probably do that

488
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:26.229
Kristen: in total. I I I went many times to Bimc. We had always running training on Saturday mornings during the winter time we we used to go to the atmosphere a lot.

489
01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:27.590
Kristen: This

490
01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:30.789
