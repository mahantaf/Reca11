00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:09.610
Bob: Hello! My name is Bob, and I'm a contractor for Fabletech. Make itfable.com

2
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.370
Bob: today. My

3
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:23.959
Bob: hardware is my dell laptop. It's a Dell latitude. It's about a year and a half hold we've got windows. 11 is my operating system, and it is

4
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.240
Bob: updated.

5
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:34.569
Bob: And then my, my screen readers. Jaws. It's jaws 2023. And it is updated to the most current

6
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:42.430
Bob: version and updates and I've been using jaws for over 30 years now, so consider myself pretty proficient at it.

7
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.420
Bob:  And then my browser's edge.

8
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.299
Bob: And so then, moving away from that.

9
00:00:51.490 --> 00:01:02.249
Bob: the purpose of this request that I've been given is to assess how I feel about the fable upskill page

10
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.650
Bob: and a couple just going through a couple of the superficial levels of the classes

11
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.709
Bob: to see if this would be suitable for me, coming as a

12
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.920
Bob: potential customer. I've been given access to a demo

13
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:27.450
Bob: and a demo account, and so now I'm I've logged in with that demo account. and then just those around the page, and and see how things

14
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.030
Bob: go and

15
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:43.360
Bob: give you my impressions. So. to start with. I always go control home to make sure the focus is at the top left corner at the very furthest.

16
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.870
Bob: the very earliest place on the page versus vertical bar fable, upscale, vertical bar fable, upskill.

17
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.230
Bob: Okay, very clear and straightforward. Thank you. I appreciate that.

18
00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:11.329
Bob: Typically, since I'm just kind of navigating around first thing since I'm up in that top left corner is I'll use my arrow keys and just arrow down and around just to see what's up in navigation for quick moment. Same page link skepta main content. Thank you for that. That's always helpful right at the beginning.

19
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:18.839
Bob: I don't always want to get stuck in navigation. and having that skip to main content is extremely helpful. Main region.

20
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.309
link, graphic fable, dashboard.

21
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.620
Bob: Okay, so this is this is one thing that I thought was a bit

22
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:40.050
Bob: redundant, and I'll tell you why in just a moment. So we've got a graphic. That's that's a link to the dashboard. But navigation region get in the navigation region. The very first link is Mr. Dwightum's link dashboard.

23
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.750
Bob: So it's linked dashboard. So it's kind of redundant. I don't know if you just want to have

24
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:56.440
Bob: for me, it'd be fine just having the graphics there at the very beginning. And in the navigation. The global navigation area is where you'd have the link.

25
00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:04.250
Bob: Just my opinion link courses. So we got the courses link. Okay? So I'm just gonna keep going through

26
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.630
navigation region. End fable, 1,692,307,485 fable button collapsed.

27
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:19.050
Bob: Not sure what that is. that says Button collapsed. It's got a whole bunch of numbers and things.

28
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:27.020
Bob: and feeble at the beginning. If this was my user Id, II suppose I would have appreciated a label saying, user id

29
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.490
Bob: right before that.

30
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:47.060
Bob:  But again, I'm I'm not sure why it would be collapsed. And I'm just curious. I'm going to click on to see what. Maybe there's some options for me with classes. Space expanded main region, banner region fable, 1,692,307,485 fable button expanded to activate, press, enter

31
00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.699
link preferences. link log out. getting level, one courses.

32
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.160
Bob: Oh, okay.

33
00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:04.150
Bob: link log out link preferences. Interesting? I'm not gonna go diving into it because it's not the the scope of the project today. But I wouldn't mind knowing what preferences we're supposed to be.

34
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.359
Bob: what preferences would be

35
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:17.290
Bob: listed under here table, 1,692 million space collapsed. So I'm collapsing that and that I'm just the other thing I wanna do right now is, see what kind of headings we've got here.

36
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:31.520
Bob: So 10 which helps me navigate through a page in the site a little bit quicker. Narrator, heading list, dialogue headings, list, view courses, Colon, 1, one of 9, to move to items, use the arrow keys. I've got 9 headings. My active courses. Colon 3, 2 of 9.

37
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.589
My accessibility journey. Beta-colon, 3, 3 of 9.

38
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:48.959
My my accessibility journey. Beta. Colon. 3, 3 of 9. Bookmarks. Colon. 3, 4 of 9. My available courses. Colon. 2, 5 of 9. Introduction to accessibility. Colon 3, 6 of 9.

39
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.140
Accessible mobile apps, Colon 3, 7 of 9,

40
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:59.189
Bob: accessible. Web development. Colon 3, 8 of 9. Accessible user experience, Colon 3, 9 of 9.

41
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:07.319
Bob: The heading is very straightforward and seem to be in a nice order. Thank you. That's helpful. I'm gonna go

42
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.650
Bob: back to the beginning of this

43
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.010
home courses, Colon 1 one of 9.

44
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.540
Bob: Okay. so just to see that it works getting level, one courses

45
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.919
getting level. 3. My active courses heading level, one courses.

46
00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.230
Bob: But kind of thought that that would be a h 2

47
00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:37.120
Bob:  only because we've we've got pretty much the H one being the landing point on the page. It's just my opinion. I'm really not assessing this for

48
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.820
Bob: accessibility and

49
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.369
Bob: all that I'm supposed to be looking at in terms of someone coming into it. But

50
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.899
Bob: it's just my opinion on, you know, cleaning up some things getting level. 3. My active courses

51
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.400
link introduction to accessibility.

52
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.080
Bob: So my active courses wonder what my inactive courses would be

53
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:06.259
Bob: my active courses. Does that mean that these are the courses that I have access to level 3 my active courses?

54
00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.400
Bob: Since I'm I'm in a demo account.

55
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:19.179
Bob: I'm just thinking, going forward. What would this mean to me? My active courses? Yes, those that I've paid for

56
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.150
link introduction to accessibility.

57
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.679
Bob: Okay. Well, let's let's see what this one is. I'm gonna hit. Enter loading page

60
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:55.610
Bob: introduction to accessibility, vertical bar, fable, upscale, vertical bar, fable, upscale. I hit control home for a reason. Same page, link, skip to main content. We've got skip to main content. Main region.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:02.770
Bob: navigation region. Okay. that's true. Williams.

64
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:17.600
Bob: listend navigation region end fable, 1,692 million breadcrum navigation region. Oh, good. There's some breadcrumbs in case I need to get out of a rabbit hole getting level, 2 breadcrumb

65
00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:30.729
Bob: list of 2 items linked courses, grader link introduction to accessibility list, end, breadcrumb navigation region end. That's always helpful. I appreciate the breadcrumbs level, one introduction to accessibility overall progress, Colon, 0% complete.

66
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:38.900
Bob: So really, all I'm doing right now is using my arrow key for a reason, because I'm just trying to discover

67
00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.269
Bob: without missing anything, heading level. 2 course details.

68
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:49.320
Learn about accessibility by understanding disability and assistive technology. This course has 6 short modules that take 5 1 0B min to complete

69
00:07:52.050 --> 00:08:05.650
Bob: 5 1 0B min. Maybe it would be more more natural. 5 to 10B min if there's a way to control that  modules.

70
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:13.030
Bob: Learn them getting level. 2 course details. Okay, so this is a relatively quick course. I like the fact that there's

71
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:22.869
Bob: information summary, of course. Purpose. Learn about accessibility by understanding disability and assistive technology, and the course has 6 short modules that take 5 dash, 1 0B min to complete

72
00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:27.649
Bob: and how long it should take to complete modules. 6. Link continue learning.

73
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.570
Bob: Okay?

74
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:36.690
Bob:  I suppose the first link the first time I come through would be start learning.

75
00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:38.679
Maybe I'm just being picky.

76
00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:46.899
Bob: Instead of continued learning, I would expect that if I was returning to them to this particular course. to continue where I left off.

77
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:54.570
Bob: But right away, I guess I'd say I would have expected to say, start learning, heading level, 2 modules, heading level, 3 about digital accessibility.

78
00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.809
Available table with 2 columns and 7 rows.

Bob: The table link me to link meet your instruct link about the introduct status.

82
00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:23.350
Bob: It doesn't sound like anything is being read from status.

83
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:34.749
Bob: Now I know this is dummy data, and I'm I'm we're walking through a demo. Ii suppose I would have expected maybe not at this point, but

84
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:44.769
Bob: something in the status field activity. Since we've got the activities link about the introductory course. Link, meet your instructor. I assume all these are activities.

85
00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:51.769
Bob: And it doesn't just move right over to a status next to each activity link, meet your co-dashing instructors, link what is digital accessibility

86
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:54.589

00:09:58.390 --> 00:09:59.520
Bob: table end

89
00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:07.519
Bob: linked digital accident. Blink, link, meet your instructor. I'm curious as to meet your instructor. Just curious to see if it's even an active link. Enter loading page

91
00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:40.129
Bob: I like to meet the your instructor. That's that's neat, link. Meet your kodas instructors and

92
00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:46.849
Bob: other instructors. Very good. Let's see down here a little bit

93
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:51.779
heading level. 3 about disability, unavailable table with 2 columns and 8 rows

94
00:10:53.210 --> 00:11:04.389
Bob: about disability. I know this is dummy content, not just wondering if this is dummy content, or what? What is going to be here? Level 3 about disability, unavailable

95
00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.249
table with activity, your experiences with accessibility unavailable

96
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.080
Bob: is this area where I would type in

97
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:29.970
Bob: incidents that I can recall of events where I'm aware of disability challenges or events that have happened. We have a 15 unavailable

98
00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:36.840
thinking about disability, unavailable cultural model of disability, unavailable. talking about disability unavailable.

99
00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:42.509
Bob: So I guess my my question would be, is, what what would be the intent of this this block?

100
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:47.569
Bob:  is it to capture my own impressions?

101
00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:54.570
Bob: Or is this stuff that I've learned from the materials disability quiz unavailable table end? It's the 2 3 screen readers

102
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:58.099

104
00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:12.970
Bob: link screen readers. Okay, alright, I got you. I got you. It's part of the training. All right. I'm gonna go back to our settings and back, going back, loading page, loading complete settings. A more left parental plus f right paren button menu.

105
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:17.539
Bob: Alright. So I don't know if I'm actually on the home page or not. I'm just gonna do a little

106
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:36.269
Bob: control f 6 control f 6 courses vertical bar. Fable, upskill vertical bar, fable, upskill dash, left bracket guest, right racket, microsoftage left parengue gestrian courses vertical bar fable upskiller okay, so what I did is control. F. 6, which takes you back to the very beginning of a website, no matter what doesn't matter where you are on the page.

107
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:44.510
Bob: So I want to get to another one. So I am going to see how these links look. We do insert F. 7

108
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:52.609
links, list, dialog links, list, view, skip to main content. One stable dashboard, 2 of 10 dashboard, 3 of 10 courses, 4 of 10.

109
00:12:54.070 --> 00:13:18.949
Bob: There's another thing, too, is the link before the navigation. 2 links in a row that say, dashboard in the list of links. Insert F. 7. It's not really clear as to what's the difference between 2? Is there a more overarching dashboard called Fable Dashboard.

110
00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:30.249
Bob: and another one may be unique to me. So we've got an organizational level that would be a little confusing. Horses, 4 of 10.

111
00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.589
Introduction to accessibility. View badges, 6 or 10,

112
00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:35.590
Bob: all of you badges.

113
00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:40.299
Bob: Hmm! What are badges? Let's see. Enter loading page.

114
00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:56.320
Bob: vertical bar fable, upscale, vertical Bar Fable, Upskill, Vertical Bar Fable, Upscale Vertical Bar. Fabel Upskill loading complete Pageness, 4 regions, 6 headings and 7 links. There are 4 smart glance highlights on this page getting level. 2 breadcrumb list of 2 items, link courses, greater link, accessibility. That whole

115
00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:02.519
Bob: bit of verbiage at the beginning seemed a little redundant and not really

116
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:14.969
Bob: coordinated through badges. I guess I would have expected it to say. View my badges or view badges, and maybe is this, since I'm the the training manager. Is this a summary of

117
00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.149
Bob: all the badges of

118
00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:32.189
Bob: all the people that are signed up for courses, or that I've signed up for courses? Or that should be taking courses. So I could look at a an overview of how many badges and what badges in a table form

119
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:36.309
Bob: that the other employees have completed

120
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:43.509
Bob: breadcrumb navigation region ends. Okay? So I want to get to it. Let's see if there's table on here. There are no tables on this page. Okay, no tables.

121
00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.160
Bob: Accessibility champions made a heading level, one.

122
00:14:49.190 --> 00:15:01.609
Bob: Disability champions. Okay? So a little confusing terminology changed from badges to champions, disability champions, care about building products that are usable for everyone. You were part of making that happen. As you learn new skills in practice

123
00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:15.329
them, you will progress through levels. Remember, every member of a team contributes to building accessible products. heading level 2 level, one accessibility champions at this level have a baseline of knowledge about digital accessibility and assistive technology. They have a strong desire to learn

124
00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:22.900
more about how they can take action to build accessible products. requirement complete that link introduction to accessibility

126
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.760
Bob: gotta admit. This is a bit confusing to me.

127
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:41.620
Bob:  I'm not sure what the intent is.

128
00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.110
Obviously

129
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:53.080
Bob: it does say, you know, it talks about completion, etc. But I go back to my previous comment, which is. would this be an overarching table

130
00:15:53.540 --> 00:16:04.280
Bob: showing the progress of the entire organization? Or is this specific to me? And again, it did change from view badges the link on the previous page on the home page

131
00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:12.429
Bob: to champions. So II am. I am a bit confused about that level 2 level 2,

132
00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:18.920
level 2 accessibility champions at this level have a baseline of knowledge about digital accessibility and assistive technology. They have a strong desire.

133
00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:24.439
Bob: Okay, so I get it. This is about the explanation of different levels. And

134
00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:25.909
Bob: I guess each

135
00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:31.670
Bob: badge is earned at the completion of a course.

136
00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:38.149
Bob: So at this level. Those people who have completed 2 courses hitting level 2 level, 2,

137
00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:47.540
level 2 accessibility champions at this level have a baseline of knowledge about digital accessibility and assistive technology. They have a strong desire to learn more about how they can take action to build accessible products.

138
00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:56.409
Bob: And I would suggest not letting these blocks of text be choppy. If if it's a paragraph of text, let it read through, is a whole paragraph of text.

139
00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:59.389
complete 4 modules from any of the other available courses

140
00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:03.679
Bob: complete 4 modules, not complete. 4 classes

141
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:06.460
Bob: status.

142
00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:14.920
Bob: It would seem that you'd have to complete a class to get a badge. My opinion.

143
00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:18.269
Bob: I guess I would prefer that

144
00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:32.470
Bob: it's not really helpful if I'm the hiring manager, the Hr manager, and I'm having to figure out what modules go with what? I guess I would have expected to see this in the chart

145
00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:35.039
Bob: with progress for each person.

146
00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.040
Bob:  Amen!

147
00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:41.980
Bob: Like I said, in the list of badges

148
00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.279
Bob: what they've completed in terms of the classes.

149
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.949
Bob: and if it's incomplete, then it's incomplete

150
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:57.500
Bob: to me. It wouldn't matter how many modules have been completed unless there's a purpose for listing that not started. Inactive fable accessibility chutting level, 2 new levels coming soon.

151
00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:05.170
Bob: having level 2 new levels coming soon. Main region end, main region end. So I'm at the end of that, all right. Well, that was interesting.

152
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:09.690
Bob: Not what I was expecting, but it was interesting.

153
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:26.760
Bob: I'm gonna go back a page to the green page again, going back loading page. See how things are moving around. Another another heading. Let's see what happens here. Well, I wanted to go back through that list of links instead of 7 Links List dialog links, list view introduction to accessible mobile apps. 8 of 10.

154
00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:45.459
Introduction to accessibility set accessible. Mobile apps, 8. Accessible web development, 9 of 10. Accessible user experience, 10 or 10 accessible accessible mobile apps, 8 of 10. Introduction to accessibility, 7 of 10 viewpages, 6 or 10.

155
00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:52.579
Bob: Introduction to accessibility, accessible mobile apps. 8 of 10. Curious that would be is that a class

156
00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:58.860
accessible, mobile apps, vertical bar, fable, upscale, vertical bar fable, upskill. Accessible, mobile apps, vertical bar fable ups breadcrumb.

157
00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:04.100
Bob: Okay. Accessible mobile apps, heading level one I hit H. For heading to go

158
00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:13.029
Bob: beyond all of this navigation. I know I could have done skip to main content, but it's easier for one jaws keystroke to hit an H and just skip beyond all that

159
00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:18.820
Bob: overall progress. Colon, 0% complete. Okay, so this sounds like a class level, one accessible mobile apps

160
00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:32.010
Bob: could be stated as a class or a module for a class progress, Colon, 0%, complete heading level. 2 course details. It does say, of course, here.

161
00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:36.559
Bob: like, I suppose, in the links.

162
00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:50.700
Bob: or somehow to identify it, it would be. It would be listed as a class, because in the links it doesn't say that it's a class. It's just a bit of information. Learn how to create mobile apps that work well for all users, including people who use assistive technology. You can choose to take the Ios or android

163
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:56.780
Bob: Us or Android stream. This course has 7 modules that take 1 0 1 5B min to complete.

164
00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:11.730
Bob: It seems like the intent would be to take both because of the popularity of both. One or the other kind of pigeonholes my people into

165
00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:19.420
Bob: one path. You know, I want to be able to develop apps that I can put on Google's play and on in the app store

166
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.070
modules one.

167
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:27.450
Bob: So this is a class of level. 2 modules getting level, 3. Mobile app accessibility. Unavailable

168
00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:31.239
table with 2 columns in activity about the mobile course unavailable.

169
00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:39.119
Meet your codach instructors unavailable about the mobile course, unavailable activity.

170
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.020
Bob: Okay, so people with 2 columns and 40's

171
00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:55.080
Bob: fill with 2 columns of 4 rows activity, I got activity about the mobile course unavailable. There's no header label for what I would assume would be status, which would be the second column

172
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:58.240
activity.

173
00:20:58.460 --> 00:20:59.850
Bob: Okay? So.

174
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:16.519
Bob: wrapping the top table with 2 columns and 40's column, one row, one activity. Okay, so and all I did was hit T again, or hit T to take me to see if there's a different table. I'm gonna hit. H. From wrapping to top breadcrum heading level, 2 accessible mobile apps heading level. One

175
00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.610
course, details, heading, level 2.

176
00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:27.720
Bob: Okay? So I just keep hitting the HTML, how to create mobile apps that work well for all users, including stream. This course has 7 modules that take modules.

177
00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:30.229
Bob: Okay. Modules. Heading level, 2.

178
00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:39.359
Getting level, 3. Mobile app accessibility. Unavailable table with 2 columns and 40's heading level. 3. Mobile app accessibility. Unavailable heading level. 2 modules.

179
00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:41.959
Bob: Okay, I hit it.

180
00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:56.490
Bob: Interesting. Well, let's see what else we've got here. Going back, loading page loading complete courses. Vertical bar, fable, upscale, vertical bar, fable, upscale, heading, level 3, link accessible mobile apps. Okay, I'm gonna do control F, 6 again.

181
00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:59.339
Bob: Just to get me back control and fourth.

182
00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:04.470
Bob: learn how to create mobile apps that work well for all users. Interesting

183
00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:09.230
control. F, 6,

184
00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.609
getting level, 3, link accessible mobile apps.

185
00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:20.139
Bob: I guess I'm I'm at the beginning of the page. Learn how to create mobile apps. That work with accessible web development heading level 3 link

186
00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:29.150
Bob: accessible web development websites that work well for all users, including people who use assistive technology. This course has 6 modules that take 1, 5, 2 0B min.

187
00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:38.710
Bob: Yeah, that whole dash 2 0. It's more natural, if it could be that timeframe could be such as 5 to 20B min to complete

188
00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:55.959
Bob: and let it read it all. There's one, if possible. understand? That might be a field. But to the user I just want to be able to read that block of text, not did be broken up overall progress. Colon, 0%, complete

189
00:22:56.130 --> 00:23:06.470
heading level 3 link accessible user experience. Learn how to build user experiences that work well for all users, including people who use assistive technology. This course has 6 modules that take 1, 5, 2 0

190
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:07.900
minutes to complete

191
00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:12.069
Bob: same thing, overall progress, colon 0% complete

192
00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.309
main region end.

193
00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:16.640
Bob: Okay, product locks round button.

194
00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:20.310
Bob: I said, main region end and then product block

195
00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:21.470
walk throughout

196
00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:23.400
Bob: spelling error

197
00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.340
product walks round button.

198
00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:32.479
Bob: That could just be the way Jaws is pronouncing it. But

199
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:36.799
Bob: let's see, I'm curious. Rao, a LKT,

200
00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:37.720
h

201
00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:46.130
Bob: ROUG. So it's not spelling. It's more of a grammar thing. Maybe I can suggest just from being picky

202
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.820
Bob: put a dash in there so that

203
00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:52.339
Bob: jaws or the screen, reader, I don't know what form

204
00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:56.540
Bob: might read that as separate words and pronounce it correctly. Walk through.

205
00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:06.639
Bob: I think someone with a with any cognitive issues related to something like this might have a problem with it, being called walk through and not understand what that is. Product block through button

206
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:10.180
product walks round button

207
00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.889
Bob: product, walks around button. Okay? So

208
00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:19.509
Bob: it said, I was at the end of main content and had this information. After that. Kind of strange.

209
00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:42.229
Bob: Alright. The only other thing that I can think of, that I'd want to do and is, I want to see. It's good virtual HTML. Features, dialog list, one list view and curs list one of 22 to move to items. Use the arrow. Let's see what else is in this layout list. 2 of 22

210
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:46.690
block quotes, list 3 of 22 buttons. List, 4 of 22,

211
00:24:47.710 --> 00:25:01.170
Bob: and take a look at the buttons. Enter to activate, press, enter, select a button dialog list. One list view product walks round button 2 or 2 to move to items. Use the Arrow key fable, 1,692,307,485 fable. Button, one and 2.

212
00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:17.779
Bob: Okay, so this is where, if I was looking at a list of buttons, neither of these would make really much sense to someone who wasn't familiar with it. Product walks around button 2 or 2. So there are just 2 buttons on the page. Escape press enter, escaping out of that.

213
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:22.940
Bob: This has been very interesting courses. Vertical bar, fable, upscale, vertical bar fable, upscale.

214
00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:29.669
Bob: Ii guess I'm gonna wrap up now and say that

215
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:31.479
Bob: I see the benefit

216
00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:38.820
Bob: in this. I think it. It's a helpful demo. I didn't really run across any accessibility. Snags.

217
00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.609
Bob: There are some opportunities, I believe, to clean up

218
00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:48.290
Bob:  just for content, clarity.

219
00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.600
Bob: and

220
00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:57.600
Bob: maybe navigation a little bit easier, such as taking a look at the heading structure on the front page on the landing page.

221
00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:04.569
Bob: But it it all made common sense. I mean, it was all yeah. It all made sense.

222
00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:10.870
Bob:  the links for the fable. Excuse me.

223
00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.890
Bob: but not.

224
00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:27.589
Bob: and I can't think of the name of it. Dashboard! There we go, fable, dashboard versus get into the navigation, and then and dashboard it. It implies that there are 2 different dashboards. I would work on that

225
00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.030
Bob: view badges. and

226
00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:42.059
Bob: see if there's more of a Hr. Way to title that as a link. and then you get to the page with

227
00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:50.259
Bob: the the championing part, and you could you could view the badges as a table at that point, for each person

228
00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:52.790
Bob: shows their status and

229
00:26:53.660 --> 00:27:00.870
Bob:  and then there there were no stati statuses

230
00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:05.500
and any of those tables. I understand that there's a lot of dummy text

231
00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:10.509
Bob: II just. And there was also a table that didn't have a column header

232
00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:14.949
Bob:  other than that I found it easy to navigate

233
00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:16.689
Bob: very straightforward.

234
00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:26.010
Bob:  I appreciate the opportunity. And normally, I'd say on behalf of fable tech. But this is fable tech

235
00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:31.390
Bob:  But thank you. Thank you for taking my input seriously

236
00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:36.300
Bob: and giving me the opportunity to review this. Have a nice day.

237
00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:38.800
Bob: Please stop.
