Thank you for the book by button.

16
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.890
kris: No.

17
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.550
kris: let's see.

18
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:48.570
kris: Okay. yeah. I see you. So right now i'm going to create an activity move to my.

19
00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:10.430
kris: So let's see. I I personally think that the is too far down personally. so I

20
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.690
fine evening

21
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.960
kris: so. But I mean, I think he was. He was very simple enough.

22
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:31.750
kris: Okay.

23
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:34.730
both

24
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.750
sorry for the past.

25
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.750
So ring, though

26
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.400
kris: I I know i'm going to click again to remove the activity

27
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.290
kris: for the moment. And

28
00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.410
kris: so, in in my opinion, I

29
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.890
kris: is too far down

30
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.230
so because that has to screw that out.

31
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.060
kris: But

32
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.550
kris: and after you're reading everything, so it just makes it.

33
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.770
kris: I I went to the bottom. but maybe you can. I don't. They work at the top.

34
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.220
and it's having the pay. So you have to

35
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.580
kris: everything down to search for the button.

36
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.110
kris: I think if everything looks good and it's seem pretty off.

37
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.010
kris: and it's usable.
