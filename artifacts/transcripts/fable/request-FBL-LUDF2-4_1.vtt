00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.180
Sheetal: Hi! My name is Shepherd, and I am an accessible

2
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:16.940
Sheetal: today. I'm going to explore a fables Upskill Demo page on my windows, laptop, and i'll be using chrome as the browser.

3
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.360
I'm using zoom text fusion as my assistive technology.

4
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.920
Sheetal: And

5
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:45.190
Sheetal: before I I I start with my task, which is exploring the page. I need to explore the content on the demo page, and maybe just go through some some activities and see how can how I can navigate through different activities

6
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:57.640
Sheetal: on that page. I'm not still logged in, so I will log in, and I will talk about my experience as I move on on the page.

7
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:21.440
Sheetal: So before that just wanted to talk a little bit about the the system technology which i'm gonna use today. So i'm gonna use zoom text fusion. which is, which uses where where I use both the zoom text magnification, feature as well as the reader. So, as I move along, I will be talking about my experience, using both the screen manification

8
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:32.340
Sheetal: and and and and reading the content as depending on how much content I have on the page so quickly. I am on the

9
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:41.020
Sheetal: the login page right now. I'll just try. I'll log in and then let's see how the the page is laid out. So

10
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.190
Sheetal: Login Page again looks quite simple.

11
00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:00.830
Sheetal: I have not magnified my screen yet. but the contrast is great for me, and the form fields are are.

12
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.840
Sheetal: or you know, Good sized so I can.

13
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.070
Sheetal: I'm able to

14
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.889
Sheetal: log in even

15
00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:26.670
Sheetal: without magnifying. But here, yes, for for typing the password. I'll be zooming in just trying to to zoom, and manually in order to to show the magnification level I I have to use while i'm typing the password

16
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.050
Sheetal: A.

17
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.020
Sheetal: Then I like the feature that I can

18
00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.810
hey?

19
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.530
4,

20
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:10.600
one

21
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.720
Sheetal: just log in

22
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.740
4 one.

23
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.570
Sheetal: So i'm on the home page right now. So, as I said, login was was

24
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:43.920
Sheetal: quite accessible for me. A big form feels just for the password. I'm 3. I just zoom in. Otherwise I have a good. So whenever I have to put in the credentials. I just zoom this screen. So just to make sure I have typed the right credentials. So this brings me to the homepage

25
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.740
again. Pictures nice and big.

26
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.130
Sheetal: The text boxes are are nicely demarcated. So

27
00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:01.580
Sheetal: just looking at the overall web page before I start exploring it.

28
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.680
Sheetal: so I can see the courses which are available to me.

29
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.520
4.

30
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:20.610
Sheetal: I don't need that much magnification. 1.4 1.2 making on the first course available.

31
00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:22.780
One.

32
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.300
Sheetal: it's called testing accessibility. So let's that. That is

33
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.140
Sheetal: forest details.

34
00:04:52.350 --> 00:05:10.060
Sheetal: As I said, I usually use a mix of screen magnification and screen reader because I with my vision. I am still I unable to read, but then it's. Sometimes it comes to tiring for my eyes, so I rely on greedo as well.

35
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:18.120
Sheetal: Let's start first, and then i'll just turn on the reader. And just to show

36
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:34.110
Sheetal: activity, I I need to explore the activities i'm just trying to see where I can find the activities here.

37
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.150
Sheetal: I can see

38
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.160
Sheetal: the available available in the demo.

39
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.790
I have been

40
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.780
Sheetal: I to explore these

41
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.240
Sheetal: because all these I think they they

42
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.460
Sheetal: being disabled, so I can't use them. So I see the link here.

43
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.840
Sheetal: I just try to go in this one.

44
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:29.330
Sheetal: So this brings me to the course which says Automated accessibility testing. Again.

45
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:37.130
Sheetal: I I feel good contrast. I really like the layout of the page. The design is simple.

46
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:44.010
Sheetal: On On the on the left side of the screen. I can see all the

47
00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.420
Sheetal: the the course outline.

48
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:56.540
Sheetal: then quite excellent, so so nothing much to an under it. I can see.

49
00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.650
Sheetal: I will find activities done.

50
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:09.220
Sheetal: Then it also gives me an idea about how many activities are there, and how many I have completed.

51
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.300
Sheetal: And also, I think this shows me

52
00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.510
which one I am right now.

53
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:18.720
Sheetal: Hmm.

54
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:25.090
Sheetal: So here, as the kind of content of the pages more it is here when I start using my reader.

55
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.580
Sheetal: The the reading feature of the zoom text

56
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.240
skip to main content courses.

57
00:07:42.360 --> 00:08:10.480
breadcrum courses, testing accessibility, automated accessibility, testing automated accessibility, testing side menu course outline skip to activity, testing accessibility, testing 5 5 5 activities done automated accessibility testing 3. S0 6 activities done automating accessibility, testing browser extensions, content editing tool Ci and testing frameworks react jest Moca Linters react

58
00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:19.400
automated testing quiz manual accessibility, testing 7 7 activities done documenting accessibility errors, 5 5 active

59
00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:21.270
Sheetal: Okay. So

60
00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:38.679
Sheetal: this is usually how how I use it. So the reader will just read, and I keep following the red box, so I know where I am, and then I don't have to use or strain my eyes to to read the content which is really helpful, and it just increases my speed, and makes me more efficient.

61
00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:42.080
So, coming back to the magnification 1.2

62
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.900
Sheetal: again. I can see the headings are nice and big

63
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:55.030
Sheetal: again. Great contrast! I can see the difference. Different links which are available.

64
00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.160
Sheetal: So this one is on

65
00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:05.940
Sheetal: using automated. Okay. So this one is about automated testing.

66
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.080
Sheetal: I'm: just trying to go through a little.

67
00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:21.200
Sheetal: So here I just want to tell you what what magnification level I am, just to give you an idea.

68
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.320
One 1.2,

69
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:31.440
Sheetal: 1.4 1 1.8,

70
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:32.610
2,

71
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:34.830
Sheetal: 2.2 5,

72
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:39.190
Sheetal: so i'm at a magnification of 2.2 5

73
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:48.110
Sheetal: again, the magnification level. Naturally for headings the level is less; but as the content

74
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:56.180
it is of different sizes, so I always have to keep increasing and increasing the magnification, while i'm going through the

75
00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.830
Sheetal: through through any content on the page.

76
00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.120
2.5.

77
00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.240
Sheetal: I think this one is is comfortable for me to read.

78
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:22.610
Sheetal: and I see there is table here which says 2 barriers.

79
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.370
Sheetal: all links in the next below.

80
00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.050
Sheetal: So this is a this.

81
00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:49.550
Sheetal: This is nice, because it it just gives me a heads up that these will open new terms, and I I really like the list

82
00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.710
Sheetal: of automated tools which are available.

83
00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:55.670
Sheetal: Hmm.

84
00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:02.610
One.

85
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.210
2, point 5,

86
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.230
one.

87
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:17.710
2, point 5.

88
00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:23.670
Sheetal: Why.

89
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:28.160
Sheetal: I see the next activity. Tab, I really like

90
00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:35.440
Sheetal: Oh. that one! As As soon as I hubble my mouse on it, it changes.

91
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:47.240
Sheetal: It changes the color which just helps relocate my mouse, because many times I lose that as well.

92
00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:55.290
Sheetal: Okay. So I am on the next activity. Now 2.5.

93
00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:13.020
Sheetal: I'm. Still at the magnification. 2.5, I think I 2.7 3, 3, point 5. But again, contrast is good, but I always try to keep the magnification more, so that I don't have to.

94
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:21.860
Sheetal: you know. Be very close to the screen in order to read it. I can see there is a video here that's late.

95
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:42.840
Sheetal: I'm. Just trying to interact with different elements which are there on the screen. Hi! This is Kate and I'm going to show you how to use the wave browser extension by web, a. To check the accessibility of a website. This is a free browser extension.

96
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.180
Sheetal: A. On like

97
00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.230
3.5.

98
00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.650
Sheetal: Why just made this full screen

99
00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:01.980
Sheetal: easy.

100
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:06.180
3.5.

101
00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:21.010
Sheetal: What we do is nice and clear. 3.5.

102
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.200
Sheetal: Oh.

103
00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:28.870
Sheetal: one, yeah.

104
00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.460
3.5.

105
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:49.080
Sheetal: Well, I I noticed that these icons are not labeled, I think yet, because I think that

106
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:53.920
Sheetal: sometimes I I don't, you know.

107
00:13:53.990 --> 00:14:08.450
Sheetal: Look at the the label. I don't look at the icons. I just do go with the with the the label which appears when I brow by, when I just cover my mouse on it. So I think that if if if that is added, it would be great

108
00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:12.930
Sheetal: or

109
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:13.930
Sheetal: yeah.

110
00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.440
Sheetal: 3.5,

111
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:22.950
then we have the video transcript. I really like this feature of your transcript

112
00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:29.060
Sheetal: one.

113
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:43.900
Sheetal: because sometimes the content is somebody you know is is speaking maybe a little fast for me, and if I try to read the captions. They they just come and go so quickly. So i'm not able to understand.

114
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:51.190
So given you getting the option of being able to read the transcript at my pace. Really, as we understand the content better.

115
00:14:52.970 --> 00:15:00.910
Sheetal: he said, this describes the video, and then we have another demo. the X E.

116
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:04.440
Sheetal: I'm. Looking on it.

117
00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:27.870
Hello, it's Kate again, and we are going to test the same website using a different accessibility tool. This time we're going to use the axe browser extension. It's made by a company called Dq. And it's available for chrome firepox. And

118
00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:43.930
Sheetal: yeah, I really like these videos, because I've heard about these extensions. But I don't know how to use them. So this you know, I'm. I'm really excited to to explore these actually in in at some point of time.

119
00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:52.440
Sheetal: because these would really help understand how these extensions can be used quickly. Going to the next activity. 3.5,

120
00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:55.760
Sheetal: one with one more.

121
00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:12.770
Sheetal: I don't know if it's my

122
00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:16.940
one.

123
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:24.720
Sheetal: my laptop as well. Today I'll just go back to the course and see if I can just

124
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:26.580
Sheetal: navigate the list there.

125
00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:34.840
Sheetal: Going back to the list.

126
00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.880
3.5.

127
00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:44.780
Sheetal: Well, I can see all the activities which which I can which are available on this page.

128
00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:50.040
Sheetal: Nineers.

129
00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:58.000
Sheetal: Okay, let's. I see this quiz if I can just quickly

130
00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:02.970
Sheetal: again all the tabs. They are quite interactive

131
00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:11.800
Sheetal: so quickly, you know, even without using the magnification, I come to know that this is a clickable link which which is really helpful.

132
00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:13.730
3.5,

133
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.680
One.

134
00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:27.810
Sheetal: Yeah. I'll just randomly click. Okay?

135
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:31.840
Sheetal: Oh, as soon as I click. I I really like this

136
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:33.900
Sheetal: a feature of

137
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:37.770
Sheetal: the choice becoming, you know

138
00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:48.120
Sheetal: again, a good clue for my I that I just selected, that I just go to the next one and see what's happening.

139
00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:54.000
One.

140
00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:09.160
Sheetal: Hi. So again, I really like the design simple design of it, though i'm on this

141
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:11.160
Sheetal: page for the first time.

142
00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:21.290
Sheetal: But you know I am able to interact with with all the elements and understand how I can navigate through the course.

143
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:31.020
Sheetal: I just go back to the close, so I believe I was able to complete the task of

144
00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:35.520
Sheetal: getting to the web page logging in and then

145
00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.620
trying to just navigate through different

146
00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:54.540
Sheetal: demo activities which are available on the page, I was able to navigate from one actually to the next.

147
00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:58.210
Sheetal: So it was. The instructions were easy to understand.

148
00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:07.100
Sheetal: and the contrast work great for me. I have to magnify the screen, which you know

149
00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:20.070
Sheetal: because of you know the size of the content. But I think that doesn't matter, because with the great contrast, I still don't have to magnify a lot.

150
00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:24.970
Sheetal: which, if the contrast was not good, I really have to go to to

151
00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:31.590
Sheetal: to a higher magnification level. So I really you know it. It worked for me
