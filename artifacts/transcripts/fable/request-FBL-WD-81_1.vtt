Kristen: Yeah, that's that. Seems to be a lot of uh.

297
00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:49.490
Kristen: It's definitely a poppy of mine

298
00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:55.490
like everyone I've talked to a lot of people that use like screen magnifier tools are saying the same thing

299
00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:55.989
Kristen: in this.

300
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.890
Kristen: Any of the hover drop-down menus, or just

301
00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:00.130
Kristen: so go.

302
00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:01.089
Kristen: It's a

303
00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:02.600
Kristen: that's what it's called. Okay,

304
00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:04.490
brand: How about that? Yeah,

305
00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:11.570
Kristen: Yeah, yeah. I immediately told my partner so he could tell his whole development team at the company.

306
00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:14.120
Kristen: Nobody likes that

307
00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:19.989
other than that. It's very I read,

308
00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:24.170
brand: I I've learned how to get around blind things here with the

309
00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:30.240
brand: the commands is always the first option to just speak it,

310
00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:33.940
brand: Tab. They are good tab road

311
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:35.430
brand: um,

312
00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:39.630
brand: and use the mouse, for it is my assumption

313
00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:44.729
Kristen: right. Do you want to show what that looks like on

314
00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:46.000
brand: Wake up!

315
00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:47.950
Kristen: That's good.

316
00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:53.830
brand: Saved you

317
00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:01.720

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:05.239
brand: right there, Right? Okay,

319
00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:07.229
What is it that they be?

320
00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:10.250
Kristen: But that's it. It's a

321
00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:14.299
Kristen: just a little extra step you have to take.

322
00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:21.049
brand: Sometimes it's more technical to me because the mouse grid may take a few seconds to

323
00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:23.600
brand: to come up, or it's a little slower

324
00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:28.989
Kristen: right. Does it ever? Um, I was thinking about like

325
00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:35.890
Kristen: like the touch kind of size, or like the focus size of buttons and things like that.

326
00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:46.720
Kristen: Is there times when you like, think one of the numbers is going to actually activate it, and then it actually doesn't, and you have to keep trying.

327
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:50.020
Kristen: It's a

328
00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:54.150
brand: to redo it. Um!

329
00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:58.490
brand: That's that's my best. That's that's all i'll be

330
00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:03.759
too fast, and

331
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:20.949
Kristen: I was wondering about that because on I was doing a bunch of mobile app testing the other day, and I kept getting all these like warnings, for, like the touch spots being too small. So there's like a little drop down menu button,

332
00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:30.670
Kristen: and the area that you could actually click on. It was super small, and it should have been a lot bigger, and that would just let people like actually

333
00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:33.989
Kristen: tap it usually easier and not directly on the thing

334
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.400
brand: i'm trying to like first. I'd be very small at this page. I don't see anything that's small, but

335
00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:50.239
brand: you know you mean sometimes it's very hard to focus right on this, but but it gets pretty precise Where? How small I can get. You know

336
00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:52.690
brand: me show you like, if I wanted to go to,

337
00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:55.079
because you're a disabled pathways.

338
00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:59.600
Kristen: I just about to click on the F. I'll show you how. Wake up.

339
00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:01.959
brand: That's great.

340
00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.669
brand: Five, one,

655

Kristen: sidewalk section instead of the city removing the snow. So

656

658

674
01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:37.959

brand: I really like to go back.

689
01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:44.839
brand: They have the underground say like,

690
01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:47.509
brand: Or is that what you're

691
01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:49.660
Kristen: Um,

692
01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:53.700

Kristen: um,

695
01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:04.370
Kristen: I don't know, like walkway connections and stuff underneath Toronto. Like through

696
01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:07.459
Kristen: most of the downtown, you can just go

697
01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:12.320
Kristen: underground and go through the subway system, which is pretty cool.

698
01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:15.060
brand: Is it like?

699
01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:17.329
brand: Well, this is like a

700
01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:20.919
brand: underground ball, like a shopping mall and stuff

701
01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:23.080
restaurants and things like that.

702
01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:24.590
Kristen: So

703
01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:26.089
brand: is that Toronto?

704
01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:28.119
Kristen: It must be Toronto. Yeah,

705
01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:30.200
Kristen: I've definitely been to some

706
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:37.569
Kristen: all like related kind of things like underground. But yeah,

707
01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:41.229
Kristen: how how far a job is it?

708
01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:44.079
Kristen: Um, It's like,

709
01:02:44.330 --> 01:02:49.490
Kristen: Hmm. An hour and a half, two hours, maybe,

710
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:55.729
Kristen: which isn't too bad, except I can't drive, so I have to take the the

711
01:02:55.820 --> 01:03:02.089
Kristen: to get a ride partway there, and then take a train into the city. So you

712
01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:03.350
brand: there, there.

713
01:03:04.410 --> 01:03:08.899
Kristen: So maybe a little bit longer of a commute for me.

714
01:03:10.450 --> 01:03:15.319
brand: It takes about an hour to get the heart through for it, for where I am.

715
01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:16.629
Kristen: Okay,

716
01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:19.140
brand: about two hours at the bus,

717
01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:49.289
Kristen: like Canada's so ridiculously big, especially Ontario, like my friends, just drove from Toronto to Portland, and it took them like three and a half days to get out of Ontario

718
01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:51.159
Kristen: to our province like.

719
01:03:51.300 --> 01:04:00.819
Kristen: But then, after that it seemed like It took just as long to get out of our province as it did to go through three other ones and then go across the border.

720
01:04:00.830 --> 01:04:02.389
Kristen: Oh, yeah,

721
01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.279
Kristen: I always wish that

722
01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:13.889
Kristen: like if we lived in the States, it'd be cool because it just seems like you can go. You can travel two hours, and there's gonna be like a pretty cool city

723
01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:16.320
Kristen: a lot of stuff to see

724
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:20.220
brand: unless you wear the

725
01:04:20.370 --> 01:04:23.689
brand: the rest the right out there.

726
01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:25.500
Kristen: Yeah,

727
01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:29.339
brand: i'm surprised. You have a like an accident.

728
01:04:30.550 --> 01:04:36.080
Kristen: I don't have an accent. Yeah, it's amazing. Oh, that's good.

729
01:04:36.490 --> 01:04:39.710
Kristen: Yeah, I love it.

730
01:04:40.070 --> 01:04:51.239
Kristen: That's really funny, because my Ah, one of my friends is from upstate New York, and she's always making fun of our Canadian accents, even though I don't think they're that much different than

731
01:04:51.250 --> 01:04:53.700
brand: no, I don't. I don't think. Yeah, though

732
01:04:55.010 --> 01:04:56.860
Kristen: I I appreciate it.

733
01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:07.489
Kristen: We're a brid like Manitoba area. They think they're a little thicker accents, and of course, come back. You have the French accents

734
01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:08.529
Kristen: here.

735
01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:14.989
Kristen: I I love an East Coast maritime accent with Newfoundland accent.

736
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.870
Kristen: Yes, yes, it's a good.

737
01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:23.450
Kristen: It's funny.

738
01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:27.299
brand: I love the southern accent like that

739
01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:32.490
Kristen: succulent a director of the area.

740
01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:37.560
Kristen: Yeah, me, too. There's something very like soothing about it.

01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:48.410
brand: It will be recorded.

742
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:50.009
Kristen: Yeah,

743
01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:52.179
no, we're getting jealous.

744
01:05:52.730 --> 01:05:57.089
Kristen: Yeah, I hope the clips that we got are good. I

745
01:05:57.220 --> 01:06:02.540
Kristen: I think I'm going to be doing the editing together. So I think. Yeah,

746
01:06:03.030 --> 01:06:07.890
Kristen: but yes, I have to remember about the recording.

747
01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:17.959
Kristen: Um, Whoever watches the video can take a look at our nice plants and

748
01:06:17.970 --> 01:06:21.890
Kristen: and think about access.
