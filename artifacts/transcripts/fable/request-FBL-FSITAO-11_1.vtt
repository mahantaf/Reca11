And of list. The most important thing to know about aria is that you shouldn't use it unless you absolutely have to. Whenever HTML is available to you. Use that instead.

17
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.210

19
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:51.420
you are current. If you can just use less than a f equals greater than when you to use alternatives to native HTML, you have to manually add lots of functionality. For example, a lesson span greater than doesn't get keyboard focus. It's hard to detect if it's been visited before. So you can apply visited length States and can be activated using the entity.

20
00:02:51.640 --> 00:03:04.220
palmer: Okay, that's all very interesting. So i'm gonna open the links menu option using control option. You
