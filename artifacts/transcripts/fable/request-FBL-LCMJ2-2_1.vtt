00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.580
Cindy: Hmm.

2
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:34.789
Cindy: Hi! This is Cindy Fable, Tester, and I am going to be looking at the fables Upskill module here for getting started on web development.

3
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:49.730
Cindy: I'm. Currently on a PC. Running windows 10, and i'm just using the built in magnification. So windows Mag and i'll be zooming in and out to navigate through today's course.

4
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:59.019
Cindy: So I am currently on, just logged in to the course.

5
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.310
Cindy: and i'm going to just look

6
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.700
Cindy: kind of orienting myself to the images here at the top.

7
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.660
Cindy: and let's see.

8
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.939
Cindy: just trying to find kind of the

9
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.570
Cindy: title to make sure i'm where I need to be in.

10
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.229
Cindy: Let's see.

11
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.429
Cindy: So I see up here the heading courses.

12
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.100
Cindy: and

13
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.160
Cindy: it looks like these are

14
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.239
Cindy: Here we go the name of the course. It took me just a second to kind of navigate

15
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:58.540
Cindy: to to Orient. How the layout is that they're not really numbered, or anything like that. But I did find the title here

16
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.580
Cindy: getting started with web development. So i'm going to go ahead and select that.

17
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.049
Cindy: I think Yes.

18
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:18.739
Cindy: all right. And i'm gonna zoom out to kinda orient myself to the page here to see the layout overall and where I need to zoom in

19
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:26.399
Cindy: all right. So getting started with web development that's good confirmation on where I need to be

20
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:33.540
Cindy: and course details. And for this paragraph I'm just gonna kinda get my

21
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.339
Cindy: reader.

22
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:48.229
Cindy: This course will provide information on web development and general accessibility of the developer experience. Whether you are new to the programs and technologies describe you, or a long time veteran of the same, the course offers content for you. This course has an emphasis on learning for people who use screen readers.

23
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.100
Okay.

24
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:52.910
and

25
00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:05.300
Cindy: let's see. So here has a list of the modules. So I believe the first. The the next task is to go through the activities for the first module.

26
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.960
Cindy: So let's see time spent.

27
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.790
Cindy: So it looks like this is a breakdown

28
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.060
Cindy: of the modules.

29
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.179
Cindy: I don't see a list of the modules that just looks like this is a heading Here.

30
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.550
Here we go. Okay.

31
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:34.089
Cindy: So continue learning. I'm assuming that's where I need to go. Don't see any other Major Buttons standing out to me.

32
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.510
Cindy: So just click to that.

33
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.400
Cindy: And let's see.

34
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.819
Cindy: Okay, we have course Outline.

35
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.030
Cindy: Okay, Getting started with web development.

36
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.680
Cindy: Okay, I'm: Assuming this is the first

37
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.110
Cindy: Okay, introduction.

38
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:13.530
Cindy: What?

39
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.390
Cindy: Okay? So I'm: assuming.

40
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.119
No, wait.

41
00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:19.690
Cindy: I'm: assuming

42
00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:20.680
Cindy: this.

43
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.270
Cindy: i'm just trying to figure out like

44
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.039
Cindy: intuitively like, Where do I go from here

45
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.540
Cindy: with these check marks here, I'm assuming that's

46
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.620
Cindy: saying is completed. And now this section here is highlighted.

47
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.280
Cindy: So let's see.

48
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.480
Cindy: Do I click on it?

49
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:55.209
Cindy: Okay, that didn't do anything i'm just trying to figure out. Where do I go from here.

50
00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.450
Cindy: So naming versus code.

51
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:08.520
Cindy: It looks like it's clickable, and it looks like it's the next thing in the list. But they all have these check marks here, some

52
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.310
Cindy: slightly confused on

53
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.469
Cindy: where and how. I just start and get into the first module.

54
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.870
Cindy: Since those all have checkmarks. I'm: like, okay, Are they completed?

55
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.430
Cindy: Hmm.

56
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.019
Cindy: Oh, wait. Okay, okay.

57
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.899
Cindy: It's been a while since I've looked at one of these. Okay.

58
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:50.790
Cindy: Now I'm: I and now i'm kind of oriented. So i'm over here. It looks like

59
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.200
Cindy: under the image.

60
00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:02.410
Cindy: Is this the module visual cdo code known as mes go? There's a free language, open source. Text editor by Microsoft that is available for windows Linux and Mac OS:

61
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:10.070
Cindy: Okay. So I'm: I'm: assuming we are now into the module over here on the right side.

62
00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.520
Cindy: Okay.

63
00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:14.190
Yeah.

64
00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.359
Cindy: Okay. Visit the

65
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:19.640
Cindy: Hmm.

66
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.110
Cindy: Oops.

67
00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.380
Cindy: All right.

68
00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.750
Cindy: So I'm: assuming these are the activities in the in the module that it's

69
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.069
Cindy: It's referring to. So going through

70
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.700
Cindy: the list here. Visit.

71
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.270
Cindy: Okay.

72
00:06:58.530 --> 00:06:59.260
Okay.

73
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.840
Cindy: alright.

74
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:12.850
Cindy: download for windows. All right, let me. I'm gonna go and look at

75
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:20.539
Cindy: Step Number 2, just to see if there's anything i'm supposed to do.

76
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.749
Cindy: Yeah. So it does want me to download.

77
00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:34.810
Cindy: Okay.

78
00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.189
Cindy: then, after I download it, what do I need to do?

79
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.609
Cindy: Okay, Follow the windows download link.

80
00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:58.600
Cindy: Alright, so we'll just pretend I downloaded that, and then.

81
00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:03.230
Cindy: following the instructions, reading through all of the

82
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:07.269
Cindy: the steps. Here.

83
00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:10.479
Cindy: once you install the program.

84
00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.020
Cindy: If you have installed any software previously, most of the prompts will be familiar to you.

85
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:19.510
Cindy: They include accepting the user license, choosing where to install the program, the program at it, doing your start, menu, and such.

86
00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:23.760
Cindy: There are a few items likely new to you unless you have previous experience with the software development program.

87
00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:36.929
Cindy: When you reach the screen asking about creating an icon on your desktop, you will also find several options talking about adding options to Windows explorer and registering the program for supporting file types. Please make it faster to open files directly in visual studio code and choosing all the default for purposes of trying things out is perfectly acceptable.

88
00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:40.900
Cindy: All right, Lots and lots of

89
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.510
Cindy: words here.

90
00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:55.040
Cindy: Okay. Some detailed steps here. But I really do like that. They are numbered. So it's really easy to kind of keep track of the sequence of steps.

91
00:08:55.390 --> 00:09:02.290
Cindy: So i'm just gonna keep going down. And then let's see. We come to a new heading here

92
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.460
Cindy: settings and help

93
00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.000
Cindy: our

94
00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:09.600
Yeah.

95
00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:26.409
Cindy: And then i'm going to actually go ahead and invert my screen into dark mode. Hopefully, this doesn't bother, you guys. But when it comes to this much text it gets very strenuous on my eyes.

96
00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:33.850
magnified into such a bright white screen. So, going into dark mode really helps.

97
00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:37.459
So let's see settings and help. And then

98
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.300
Cindy: so

99
00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.919
Cindy: the dialogue also talks about using control, plus m to it. Just how the tab key behaves when editing.

100
00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:49.510
Cindy: using control plus mtugs between inserting a cap character in your code or moving to the next focus of the item to get to

101
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.930
Cindy: Okay. And then

102
00:09:54.500 --> 00:10:00.070
Cindy: continuing on down the module that you can press control plus agent any point for accessibility help.

103
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.490
Cindy: This will open the web page in your browser with more information on using visual studio code.

104
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:05.740
Cindy: Great. Okay?

105
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.369
Cindy: And then I like that that like the button contrast changing here

106
00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.759
Cindy: new activity. Next activity.

107
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.830
Cindy: Okay, I'm: assuming this is still all part of the next module.

108
00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:29.729
Cindy: It looks like we have a video here. I see a play button that happened to jump out at me. I'm gonna

109
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.620
Cindy: cool back out of my invert here.

110
00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:36.830
Cindy: 8.

111
00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:45.360
Cindy: Okay. I was gonna pretend I I saw that video that

112
00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:48.539
Cindy: opened up. Well, and

113
00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:53.030
Cindy: it's good. At first I thought it was an image, but I happen to

114
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:59.799
Cindy: see this bar pop up here with that play button there that indicated it was a video to me.

115
00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:02.979
Cindy: Let's see. Okay.

116
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:09.730
Cindy: So we just gotta pretend we saw that and keep moving on next

117
00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.460
Cindy: activity.

118
00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.670
Okay.

119
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:16.779
Cindy: Okay, I'm: assuming

120
00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:19.380
Okay.

121
00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:24.169
Cindy: writing code Looks like there's another play button.

122
00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:29.569
Cindy: Another video here that played

123
00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.290
Cindy: Well.

124
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:33.440
Cindy: okay.

125
00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:38.960
Cindy: we're just gonna keep moving on to to the next activity.

126
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:45.060
Cindy: Okay, looks like it loaded up and

127
00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.569
reviewing code.

128
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:54.690
Cindy: And it's another video. I see that play button there.

129
00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:58.129
Cindy: Okay, reviewing code that's loaded up.

130
00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:00.220
Cindy: Well.

131
00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:05.180
Cindy: I see this

132
00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:08.860
Cindy: here.

133
00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:11.800
Cindy: Hmm.

134
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:14.519
Cindy: Okay, Our next activity.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.470
Cindy: And

136
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:20.640
Cindy: hmm.

137
00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:22.349
Cindy: This is different.

138
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:33.350
Cindy: Are you on visual studio code?

139
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:39.730
Okay. So it looks like i'm done with the videos.

140
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:46.610
Cindy: And we're into a new section here.

141
00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:56.900
Cindy: so it looks like it's kind of going into a new activity of Try it yourself.

142
00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:11.070
Cindy: Do all of these steps here which you get our number. So that's good

143
00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:14.990
Cindy: and just kind of going through all those steps.

144
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:18.300
Cindy: Let's see. We have a new thing here.

145
00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:25.769
Cindy: So creating and writing a web page.

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:30.799
Cindy: and it's taking us to more steps here of

147
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:33.830
Cindy: creating a web page.

148
00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:39.540
Cindy: Looks like we've got an image here of code

149
00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.319
under this.

150
00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:53.190
Cindy: Okay, so can I come? Oh, good. Okay, it's allowing me to highlight and select it.

151
00:13:53.580 --> 00:14:10.999
Cindy: So just pretend I can copy that that seem to be good copy and paste the following text into the file: After you copy and paste the text into your file. Use the open down, hero to review all of the text ensure no lines have run together. Press control plus has to save your file. You'll be prompt.

152
00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:14.549

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.769
Cindy: going through all those steps.

154
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.300

just a

157
00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.070
Cindy: and

158
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:34.239
visual studio code. It's like when you develop your tools i'll be the range. It

159
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:40.100
Cindy: so it looks like we're going into a whole series of steps and such here.

160
00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.750
I'm sorry about this.

161
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.900
and

162
00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:49.250
Cindy: for his control wasn't to create a new file.

163
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:57.729
Cindy: I'll just pretend we're going through more steps here. Press F. 6 wants to move to the stand as far

164
00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:07.100
Cindy: Press right here until you read an item that says plain text, this is where you are going to tell regionals. You should be asked to set the language

165
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:11.729
Cindy: just taking us through all of those processes

166
00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:16.100
Cindy: Looks like there's lots and lots of steps here.

167
00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:25.629
Cindy: And now we're to a new section. It looks like, okay. So visual studio commands.

168
00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.860
Okay.

169
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.340
Cindy: Alright, and

170
00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:39.040
Cindy: so we have a more series of steps and code to insert.

171
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:49.840
Cindy: Okay, and then a new thing of moving around visual studio code.

172
00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:08.790
Cindy: I like that. It seems to be kind of like very sequential, and going just literally going from section of steps down to the next section of steps.

173
00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:13.880
Cindy: So it's one kind of like continuous page, and i'm not hitting, you know.

174
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:21.219
Cindy: next next next too much through all of this, but it's broken up here into this next activity.

175
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:28.040
Cindy: So I liked how to how it just lit. As I was going down the page through these steps.

176
00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:29.130
Cindy: I

177
00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.910
Cindy: automatically run into this

178
00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:37.299
Cindy: the control buttons here and can go to the next activity.

179
00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:43.860
Cindy: All right, let's see. So introduction.

180
00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:46.980
Cindy: Okay. So

181
00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:55.610
Cindy: is this the end, or how many more steps in the module? Do we have? I'm not sure.

182
00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:00.530
Cindy: I'm wondering that's this list

183
00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:05.080
Cindy: over here. And oh, that's nice. Okay, i'm just now i'm kind of getting.

184
00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:06.730
Cindy: I think.

185
00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:26.810
Cindy: No, I guess it is all part of that I was just trying to figure out. If over here it showed the progress through the module, as i'm going just so can kind of paste just for pacing purposes. But I don't see that that information

186
00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:42.879
Cindy: give up is a co-hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others working in Internet access. You don't need to know them. Okay. So just continuing on to this activity, I don't that looks like just an image. I don't think it's a video or anything we need to watch.

187
00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:45.350
Cindy: So i'm going to continue on.

188
00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:50.560
Cindy: And here we go.

189
00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:53.960
Cindy: all right.

190
00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:01.190
Cindy: Oh, this must be a video. Yeah, okay, here's the play button.

191
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:06.119
Cindy: all right, and that loaded up. Well.

192
00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.290
Cindy: okay.

193
00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:15.229
Cindy: move to the next activity that loads. Well, okay.

194
00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:20.790
Cindy: Okay, Desktop

195
00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:23.820
Cindy: got another video here that's

196
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.939
Cindy: good.

197
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.579
Cindy: At this point. I really appreciate

198
00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:36.609
Cindy: videos and things like that when there's this much like words and codes and stuff to look at. It's nice to have

199
00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.510
Cindy: these videos to kind of help break up the module.

200
00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:45.309
Cindy: Okay, submitting an issue.

201
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.059
Cindy: Okay. So we've got more videos here that

202
00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:57.040
Cindy: loaded. Well, okay, we're gonna continue on

203
00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:58.999
Cindy: next activity.

204
00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:06.790
Cindy: Okay. So here we're into

205
00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:10.310
Cindy: more of the text. Let's see. Try it yourself.

206
00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:12.420
Cindy: Okay.

207
00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:15.169
Cindy: So again we're gonna.

208
00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.210
Cindy: I guess it's gonna walk us through the process

209
00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.380
Cindy: of trying it ourselves

210
00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:25.930
Cindy: again. The instructions are numbered here. That's great for

211
00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:31.250
Cindy: kind of keeping track of the sequence. And here's another section.

212
00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:33.760
Cindy: Okay, try to.

213
00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:34.910
Nice.

214
00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:44.729
Cindy: Okay, we're just going to keep going through these sections of instructions

215
00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:49.030
Cindy: to complete the try it yourself portion.

216
00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:55.550
Cindy: And again, we just kind of naturally run into the

217
00:19:56.010 --> 00:20:00.489
Cindy: and here we can go to the next activity.

218
00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:04.419
Cindy: and we are back to some videos.

219
00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:06.840
Cindy: So let's see, this is

220
00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:10.790
Cindy: okay.

221
00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.910
Cindy: Okay, it's video

222
00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:21.229
Cindy: that

223
00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.530
Cindy: loaded well

224
00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:28.620
Cindy: hit that next activity.

225
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:37.060
Cindy: Okay.

226
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:43.050
Cindy: Just continuing on to this next activity.

227
00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:50.950
Cindy: Alright.

228
00:20:53.310 --> 00:21:03.209
Cindy: Yeah, okay, All those are going well so far. Oh, this is large and grabbed my attention. Super, quick. Here.

229
00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:05.800
Cindy: Okay, let's let's see.

230
00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:17.070
Cindy: Alright, Looks like, so right under this video. It's taking us into another section

231
00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:20.230
Cindy: of instruction for this

232
00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:24.359
Cindy: Microsoft Kinda learn

233
00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.160
Cindy: learning section.

234
00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:37.070
Oh.

235
00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:49.540
Cindy: sorry about that. A screen jumped around. You're learning this summer. And throughout Ms this month, by participating in a fun and self-paced technical upstream, challenge, track your progress, using the leader board as you navigate the open source and accessibility, where they found challenges on Microsoft Digital learning Platform

236
00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:51.110
Cindy: Alrighty

237
00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:58.670
Cindy: an entry into the grand prize drop at a chance to win one of 2 surface laptop studio devices. Well, that sounds nice.

238
00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.890
Cindy: Okay, we'll go to the next activity.

239
00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:06.819
Cindy: So far, so good.

240
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:09.180
Cindy: Okay. Wrapping up.

241
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:11.080
Cindy: That's

242
00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:17.079
Cindy: a great indicator that I'm close to the end. This course is just the beginning. If something and what you'd

243
00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:18.940
Cindy: all right.

244
00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:24.109
Cindy: So it looks like we have another video here

245
00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.050
Cindy: and

246
00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.830
Cindy: go to the next activity.

247
00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:36.069
Cindy: Okay? And then we're to the about.

248
00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.490
Cindy: Okay.

249
00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:51.630
Cindy: Got an image. Looks like someone holding a phone.

250
00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:53.880
Cindy: Okay.

251
00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:01.110
Cindy: let's see here.

252
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:05.659
Cindy: Oh, he doesn't want to read this section all of a sudden. Okay?

253
00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:11.060
Cindy: Okay. So about the mobile course.

254
00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:15.450
So this is one of 3, one of 3. What?

255
00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:26.150
Cindy: Okay? It looks like. We have another

256
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:29.250
Cindy: section here

257
00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:31.820
Cindy: clickable links.

258
00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:35.819
Cindy: I can tell that they're blue and underlined, and they're numbered.

259
00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:39.959
Cindy: I'm. Assuming it's a sequence of things to click.

260
00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:43.280
Cindy: You can choose the lessons most relevant to your role. And you don't do the course.

261
00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:44.940
Okay.

262
00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.330
Cindy: Alrighty.

263
00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:53.780
Cindy: And then Co. Instructor.

264
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:56.310
Cindy: Okay, so this is about the

265
00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:59.920
Cindy: instructor. Let's see.

266
00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.490
Cindy: And then navigating.

267
00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:10.030
Cindy: going through all these different sections. This is pretty detailed.

268
00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:14.269
Cindy: Okay, getting help

269
00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:20.069
Cindy: all right. Next activity.

270
00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.429
Cindy: This is

271
00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:31.030
Cindy: I'm: sure. It probably makes sense to someone who knows stuff about coding

272
00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:34.139
Cindy: definitely above my head.

273
00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:39.730
Cindy: Okay. So about the Q. A testing course.

274
00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.320
Cindy: All right. Let's see.

275
00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:53.349
Cindy: Okay. And this is about the

276
00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:58.649
Cindy: more sequences. So i'm assuming these are like, maybe

277
00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:09.660
Cindy: this is all kind of wrapping up, and and I guess introducing maybe the next courses and instructors and such.

278
00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:16.309
Then it looks like we're coming up on a course survey.

279
00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:20.009
Cindy: The survey will take approximately 4B min to complete.

280
00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.119
Cindy: Your feedback is very important to us.

281
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:30.100
Cindy: and I I don't want to complete this survey because I didn't actually do the course.

282
00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:35.650
Cindy: So i'm just going to keep going through.

283
00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:37.080
Cindy: Is it?

284
00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:42.950
Cindy: The text here is really faint

285
00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.229
Cindy: here.

286
00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.419
Cindy: I usually like

287
00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:51.210
Cindy: the

288
00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:56.330
Cindy: I usually like.

289
00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:58.890
Cindy: Select your answer.

290
00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:12.939
Cindy: I I usually like the the instruction to be bolder above the text, the selection box. That's just a personal preference for me only because when it's faded out in that small.

291
00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:16.569
Cindy: it's a little bit more difficult, and I straining.

292
00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:23.149
Cindy: Oh, these stars pop up! That is helpful.

293
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:38.219
Cindy: I usually don't like this whole star thing. These are large enough that i'm able to do that. But the way my eyes work I i'm constantly looking around, and it's a little difficult for me to count.

294
00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:41.460
Cindy: sometimes stars. But the way this is

295
00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:44.480
Cindy: visually done and

296
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:57.040
Cindy: highlighted as I scroll across them, makes it a little bit more accessible, but I almost kinda wish it was more of like a number I could click instead of the Star Graphic

297
00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:59.690
Cindy: only because

298
00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:02.709
Cindy: the Star Graphics are are just

299
00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:07.729
Cindy: visually a little bit more difficult for me to identify and read

300
00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:14.449
Cindy: as a rating. I prefer more of a new numeral representation there

301
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:25.879
Cindy: and then we. It looks like we have some options to select here for this section of the survey.

302
00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:34.740
Cindy: the check boxes, which all look great to me, pretty intuitive here. And then we have a text writing

303
00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:38.699
Cindy: a text box here. What does that say again.

304
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:44.659
Cindy: it's so small. I have to really zoom in to see that faint writing inside.

305
00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:47.699
Cindy: Enter your answer. Okay.

306
00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:58.120
Cindy: and another text box. Enter your answer.

307
00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:08.000
Cindy: And so we have a series of those types of questions, and then I guess i'm not sure if we hit, submit, if it will

308
00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:10.539
Cindy: let me go through without

309
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:17.510
Cindy: putting in anything it looks like it will not. But if this is the end of this

310
00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:22.670
Cindy: first module, I believe one of the instructions was to kind of go over in.

311
00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:26.899
Cindy: try to see if I can find my my completion

312
00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:32.850
Cindy: part, and I was kind of speaking about that earlier.

313
00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.599
Cindy: and i'm assuming that's what

314
00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:43.010
Cindy: this part is

315
00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:45.720
Cindy: over here on the left side.

316
00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:55.290
Cindy: So once I create finished the quiz, I am then assuming that I would get like a

317
00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:57.059
Cindy: checkmark here.

318
00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:07.789
Cindy: And so yeah, I guess this is kind of like walking you through the steps as you complete them.

319
00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:20.370
Cindy: having, I think, a numeral to also represent this, because they're not really numb. Like it's not really numbered.

320
00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:25.519
Cindy: and as you go down sometimes it's

321
00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:33.090
Cindy: the way this layout is the progress as you're going through the module wasn't really like clear

322
00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:35.360
Cindy: at

323
00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:37.810
Cindy: first.

324
00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:44.669
Cindy: I I understand the layout now, and now that I understand this type of layout.

325
00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:50.069
Cindy: It's pretty intuitive, but at first it wasn't.

326
00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:53.630
Cindy: But I think that's just personal preference, and what you're

327
00:29:53.730 --> 00:30:00.679
Cindy: used to seeing and deducing from the layout, and

328
00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:11.369
Cindy: I feel like I've seen like a progress bar with like a percentage or a step, 6 of 12 or that type of

329
00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:16.580
Cindy: the progress Indicator.

330
00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:17.730
Okay.

331
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:28.230
Cindy: this is you just have to scroll through the whole list to sort of conceptually understand how long the list is and where you are on it.

332
00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:35.049
Cindy: and and instead of just having that information kind of given to you, and

333
00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.760
Cindy: a

334
00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:43.700
Cindy: number form like you're on 5 of 23 or whatever the case may be.

335
00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:45.950
So

336
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:48.740
Cindy: let's see

337
00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:54.019
Cindy: if I were able to submit the quiz. Wait! What's this?

338
00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:59.230
Cindy: Well, it's given me a next activity Here

339
00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:02.290
Cindy: it was this for the quiz

340
00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:07.809
Cindy: next activity. Let's try that. See what?

341
00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:17.610
Cindy: See what happens here?

342
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:20.360
Cindy: Okay?

343
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.120
Cindy: So

344
00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:33.960
Cindy: well, we got check marks by all of these.

345
00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:38.180
I think that's another thing like when i'm really kind of zoomed into

346
00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:39.140
Cindy: like

347
00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:45.040
Cindy: like. I remember going through the wrapping up when i'm reading through all these titles, I don't see the check mark

348
00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:50.410
Cindy: either in this layout of progress through the module. I

349
00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:55.610
Cindy: really have to zoom out or have to scroll over. And then, when i'm looking at the checkmarks.

350
00:31:55.720 --> 00:32:01.519
Cindy: what does the checkmark go to? I can't see them both at the same time. If that makes sense.

351
00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:09.650
Cindy: Okay, so accessibility quiz, we already looked at that. I think that's what I was trying to hit the submit button on before.

352
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:16.630
Cindy: Yeah, Here.

353
00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:21.800
Cindy: start quiz off Here we go. So we haven't even done that yet. Okay, we just did the survey.

354
00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:24.650
Cindy: Okay.

355
00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:29.420
Cindy: So I'm just going to, I guess. Start the quiz and

356
00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:32.659
Cindy: see where that takes us.

357
00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:35.910
Cindy: all right.

358
00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:40.909
Cindy: Oh, goodness, I'm probably not going to get any of these answers correct.

359
00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:44.930
Cindy: Which is, he lets you change whether an element is focused by setting a numeric value.

360
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:49.440
Cindy: Okay? Well, so i'm not sure

361
00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:50.399
it

362
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:53.090
Cindy: if we can pause for just a second.

363
00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:08.720
Cindy: Okay. So we're looking at this quiz, we're just continuing, and i'm just going to pretend to answer all of these questions Here, finish

364
00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:13.210
Cindy: and okay.

365
00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:14.640
Cindy: So we have the

366
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:22.839
Cindy: quiz. This looks like a bar image here. Your results one of 2, hey?

367
00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:26.369
Cindy: Not bad, considering. I have no idea.

368
00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:30.569
Cindy: It looks like we have a retry or

369
00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:33.909
Cindy: show solutions.

370
00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:36.210
Cindy: It's show solution

371
00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:37.870
Cindy: Hex.

372
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:42.260
Cindy: the quiz. Okay, so it looks like we got that one.

373
00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:43.060
And

374
00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:44.370
Cindy: and

375
00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:47.969
Cindy: it was actually false. Okay.

376
00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:49.860
Cindy: she's the right.

377
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:52.050
Okay.

378
00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:59.050
Here we go.

379
00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:02.730
Cindy: continuing on it's gonna

380
00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.620
Cindy: all right.

381
00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:14.550
Cindy: Here's the progress. One of one.

382
00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:16.000
Cindy: All right.

383
00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:19.050
Cindy: if I hit finish.

384
00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:26.589
Cindy: Okay, I'm a little confused. Now let's see. Show

385
00:34:27.949 --> 00:34:29.129
Cindy: solution.

386
00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:33.790
Cindy: We did that already. Can I finish

387
00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:38.189
Cindy: show solutions? Still.

388
00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:39.799
Cindy: Oh, there we go.

389
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:41.529
Cindy: Okay, Where are we?

390
00:34:45.739 --> 00:34:48.349
Cindy: Okay? So we started with web development.

391
00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:54.489
Cindy: Okay, course details. Okay. So this is back to the beginning

392
00:34:55.739 --> 00:34:57.140
Cindy: of the course.

393
00:34:58.960 --> 00:34:59.910
Cindy: So.

394
00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:02.700
Cindy: hey? I guess we're done.

395
00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:05.959
Cindy: Okay.

396
00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.890
This has taken me back to the beginning.

397
00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:14.640
Cindy: I bet. So I am assuming everything is done. I don't

398
00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:17.589
Cindy: see

399
00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:19.479
Cindy: a

400
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:26.220
Cindy: progress bar, or anything, or like completed, or like a I guess, a

401
00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:31.630
Cindy: ending landing page. It just sort of took me back to the beginning. Here.

402
00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:36.740
Cindy: I'm not sure if that's what is supposed to happen. So i'm kind of left with a

403
00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:41.459
Cindy: confused feeling sort of like. I think i'm done

404
00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.120
Cindy: so all right.

405
00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:50.899
Cindy: That's I'm gonna leave it there. Thank you so much for choosing fable. And this concludes: today's task.

406
00:35:55.250 --> 00:36:02.100
Cindy: Okay, and just to summarize today's task. I was.

407
00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:15.669
Cindy: I really liked the flow of it moving from videos kind of demonstrating and showing all the different steps, and then leading you through the try it yourself sections.

408
00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:26.869
Cindy: It looked really detailed. I'm. Assuming those who are capable and able of this level of accessibility web development understood a lot of that.

409
00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:35.919
Cindy: It looked like. It was pretty complicated. There were a lot of steps, a lot of things to complete and kind of go through in the processes.

410
00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:41.330
Cindy: but I really did like that they were numbered. It really kind of helped, you understand where

411
00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:54.139
Cindy: you know. I could see I could easily kind of follow what step of that i'm on in that specific section, and then you move to the different section, and I like to that. There were big, bold headings

412
00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.930
Cindy: separating the different sections

413
00:36:57.250 --> 00:37:06.180
Cindy: in that. Try it yourself, area of the module, and it then took you back into video. So I really liked how that kind of broke it up.

414
00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:13.630
Cindy: The only thing that I sort of left was a little confused on is when I,

415
00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:26.180
Cindy: because I am pretty far down on this spectrum of blindness. I'm zoomed in pretty significantly. And so there were moments where I was a little disoriented, a little lost, as far as

416
00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:34.170
Cindy: you know, where the main focus needs to be on on the page, and where

417
00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:47.109
Cindy: the starting point is. I was kind of looking at that left menu which I now understand is sort of the progress and sequence through the module.

418
00:37:47.120 --> 00:38:05.559
Cindy: I thought, okay, do I need to click this to start the module because I was so zoomed in? I didn't realize it had automatically opened, but it was on the right side of the screen, so that left me feeling a little confused, and it took me well to also realize that when.

419
00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:09.930
Cindy: as soon as I started the course that that left side was the

420
00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:11.549
Cindy: sequence.

421
00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:17.849
Cindy: but they weren't numbered, I think, having a number to represent. You know

422
00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:34.690
Cindy: this. You know your sequence through the module would would help, you know, moving from the videos to the Try yourself, sections, and having by that by the title above the videos that were nice and bold.

423
00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:37.170
Cindy: having some sort of numeral

424
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:38.669
Cindy: to represent

425
00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:43.689
Cindy: the sequ. The the progress through the sequence like, you know.

426
00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:49.050
Cindy: Section 5 of 12, or whatever the case may be.

427
00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:54.690
Cindy: that would have been a little helpful and a lot easier to

428
00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:56.370
Cindy: conceptualize

429
00:38:56.730 --> 00:39:00.330
Cindy: where i'm at in the Module compared to

430
00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:04.249
Cindy: to seeing that that long list on the left side.

431
00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:05.689
and

432
00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:11.029
Cindy: also trying to figure out, you know which title has a checkmark by it, and such

433
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:36.750
Cindy: other than that. Yeah, Everything seemed to be pretty intuitive, and I really liked that. The buttons also really grabbed my attention towards the bottom, and it could it? The contrast of the color changed for the button for next activity, and such that really kind of helped confirm. Okay, this is the next intuitive place to go, and

434
00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:38.900
Cindy: I felt very validated, and and that

435
00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:42.709
Cindy: that's that's the button I need to click to go to next.

436
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:49.540
Cindy: So everything else was great and pretty intuitive, and I had no problems.

437
00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:51.660
Cindy: a at least understanding

438
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:54.609
Cindy: and figuring it out so

439
00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:57.229
Cindy: that's it. Thank you.
