00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.420
It's going to. It's really hard, but it's it's it's it's it's a lot of people. People People don't like they don't like it.

2
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.830
roger: Hi, everyone! How are you? This is Roger and I'm an accessibility tester with fable.

3
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:23.420
roger: and today i'm going to be taking a look at fable upscaling. I'll comment to you on the accessibility and usability of this service.

4
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.600
roger: I'll be using my screen, reader, which is jaws running on a windows 10 laptop

5
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.340
roger: with chrome as my browser, and essentially the task is. Just

6
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:51.980
roger: poke around and check it out and try out some of the activities. And then just sort of give you some of my comments based on just, you know, doing that little cursive browse, and that's what i'm going to do. So I've already logged in using the credentials that were provided to me.

7
00:00:52.080 --> 00:01:02.110
roger: And we're gonna just basically start at the top. I'm gonna take my screen, reader, make sure the focus is at the top of the browser Internet browser window.

8
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.860
roger: Okay.

9
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.470
roger: yeah, let's see if there's any regions first off.

10
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:12.390
maybe the

11
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.430
roger: okay

12
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:14.540
like to go. Better

13
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.570
never get a meeting

14
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.490
ready to stop my meeting.

15
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:32.880
roger: Okay, that kinda threw me off a bit here when i'm like, let me just back up and say the context of me checking to see if there's any regions is something that I do that helps me break up

16
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:40.330
roger: a page that I've never visited before into kind of like little digestible sections to get a lay of the land.

17
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.380
and the first region that I encountered was Maine. Then we have, I think, it was a banner.

18
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.390
roger: and then a navigation region.

19
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.350
roger: That kind of throws me up because I usually expect the banner.

20
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.240
roger: then the navigation region, then the main

21
00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:59.370
roger: it.

22
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.120
roger: It's going to be interesting to see how this page is laid out, because if you want to think of it like

23
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.850
roger: your banner is almost like your your cover page on a book like the title.

24
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:18.690
roger: The Navigation Region is kind of like a table of contents, which would be the next logical thing you would find in a book.

25
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.540
roger: and then your main region is like, you know, like all the chapters and the information.

26
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:33.480
roger: So in my mind, this page just seems to be laid out with the regions a little bit differently than I would intuitively expect.

27
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:42.450
roger: But let's see what you have up your sleeve, so that's just something that caught my attention right now. Let me see if you have any headings. So i'm going to take my

28
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.450
roger: focus up to the top.

29
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.910
roger: Get a feel for sections, such as titles and areas

30
00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.690
of of discussion on the page. What's the next one? My name will post it to. That's specifically any more. We

31
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:09.980
It's like it's it's really getting more freely accessible equipment. Anyone cleanly accessible to experience that you don't really like that's all the web setting up ready to talk to anyone.

32
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.470
roger: Okay, that that sounded very logical.

33
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:24.270
roger: You don't have a lot of headings there which is good. I mean, you know everybody thinks oh, you're blind. You must have supersonic hearing. Oh, you're blind. You must have a super awesome memory.

34
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.410
roger: Well. for some people, yes, some people know. and if you load it up with too many headings.

35
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:40.040
roger: They serve as a disservice because of that just means there's way too much sections for me to try to remember to conceptualize what's on this page. So

36
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.040
roger: that look good.

37
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.190
roger: Okay. Now, I just want to start up at the top again.

38
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.170
What? It's it's it's it's the main content.

39
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.660
roger: Okay, that's good that you've got that link. Let me try it out. So it's simply a contingent.

40
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.730
Same thing. It's a to be content.

41
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:54.610
roger: Hmm.

42
00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:04.110
roger: What's it for a lot of people to you. Same thing. Let's keep the main content. Let's try that. One more time. It's it's it's it's

43
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:11.180
roger: Sometimes those links are just like they don't do anything. So we skipped to the main content. Okay.

44
00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:18.240
roger: but i'm aing with descriptions over the context menu when they're they're heading up freely, testing specifically. Oh, I can't see them of descriptions over the context, menu when they're

45
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:33.010
roger: I I I kinda don't always understand that. But let me try it. Application it's been.

46
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.910
roger: but my preference is to

47
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:43.850
roger: like have

48
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.030
an image labeled.

49
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:51.410
roger: Obviously the information there would be too much to put in an actual label.

50
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.980
roger: But I would just prefer that a an image is labeled.

51
00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:07.960
We're not the it's about about it, but it's the way people use this technology. It's where I find multiple texts, and that's why they're in the same of a description. So it's a competitive for me testing disability. Okay, we're not the same website of the applications. The way people uses the technology it's what I find about will I take the next. The complete overall rock is about 10% of we

52
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:16.750
that in the premiere of the we're about a disability by percenting this billiona of the technology, because it's it's for models that take like by tenants. They don't, we don't know it's it's a we're going to be cutting the we're going to have a little bit.

53
00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:24.050
One of the buildings like that. We're over there, and when people use this as a technology, it's what it's it's it's it's it's. It's it's but at least overall it's always the over and complete.

54
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.000
roger: Okay, it's very good, like the layout of the content.

55
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.270
roger: very understandable. And the progress is very easy to understand.

56
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:42.000
I don't know if it's going to one of the buildings experiences that we're over there, and when people use this technologies because i'm 6 models that take 15 t0 20B min a week overall. Probably it's only a percent that we add in the freely accessible of labs.

57
00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:50.750
Okay, no freely accessible plants or not to be able to support the world. There's simply people who use this technology, but with the details with I mean overall it's always the percent complete. Maybe we don't it.

58
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.840
roger: Okay, the world's we have to be able to add in a freely to a little of let's try this one

59
00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:04.420
because it's a little. Recommend it to me, and i'll do it, but it's it's like it's like it's it's it's it's it's it's it.

60
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:11.230
roger: Okay, that's good. That comes on understandable.

61
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:24.670
We're not going to be able to that. We're over there, and it's like people use this to technology. But to the I was a man with screen because I had a model to take 1015B min, and we we' it t0 0ur category. Mobiles 7. So you're always like to change like 2020 for me. Looks like one.

62
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.970
roger: Is that today's date. Hmm. In today's the seventeenth.

63
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.530
roger: Why, we're one day off. Who knows?

64
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.280
Technically we'll get back to you.

65
00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.170
roger: Okay, Take with some comments in those activity collimator

66
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.530
possible for some people to.

67
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.120
roger: Okay. So we got a table here.

68
00:06:54.930 --> 00:07:07.020
I can't. I mean a collection. So for some people, a couple of but act of the you know it's it's it's a little different. but it's a it's a 1 billionpeople. We can go Actually, most of the time. It's a 1 million people don't want it actively, but it's not because it's a 1 million people in the one.

69
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:09.440
I can't, but it's a it's a 1 billionpeople to have a couple of

70
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.460
roger: Hmm. There's only one column. We can go

71
00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.620
actively, but it's a it's a it's a it's a one.

72
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:28.600
roger: For some reason I was thinking that there was. Let me go back up to the top. because it's only allowing me to toggle just in one column

73
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.410
top of top column. Take with some of those.

74
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:39.280
roger: Oh, that's why 2 columns and a road. That's what made me think that there was 2 columns, but I was only able seemed like

75
00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.110
roger: to just be in one column

76
00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:44.920
about a couple of people in

77
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:53.180
meet a coach, and some people know we can go actively, meaningful that it's not something we'll never call them one actively meet a coach. And so for some people we have a call about it.

78
00:07:53.740 --> 00:08:00.880
roger: Okay, so i'm that's only one column.

79
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:06.550
roger: Now i'm going to go to the right, and I should go to column 2 actually. But we'll be able to come on.

80
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:13.030
We can go actually, but we'll just really we'll have a one. actually, but we'll definitely we'll get a long one.

81
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.900
roger: Okay, so i'm not really sure what's happening there. But I

82
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:24.750
roger: I know that something is not available, but it should really allow me to go to the second column.

83
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.210
roger: and i'm invoking the command.

84
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:33.179
roger: and it's going, but it's repeating back to me that it's an only in column one.

85
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:40.490
roger: So I think that should be revisited by the problem. Okay, let's take a look at the we'll be able to take a look at the labs. Take with some other details.

86
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.370
I think, with some common articles. I can tell you how the better it's supporting them. They're They're not.

87
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.880
Let me have a little bit of a It's voting back in the

88
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:59.750
roger: So there's a column header. There's only one column header and the same thing, I believe. was for the other one that we just saw.

89
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.170
I'm going to have a little.

90
00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:10.730
roger: so i'm not sure if you are the cause of this is because of not having a second heading.

91
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.700
roger: Now, at the same time.

92
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:19.610
roger: lot of things are not available as well. but you might want to just revisit this and and see.

93
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:27.990
roger: Did you intend to be there to be 2 columns? Therefore there should be 2 headers, even if the second column is unavailable.

94
00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:33.560
roger: Let's just go and see if there's a third column. Okay.

95
00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.830
when i'll do activity about my i'll do

96
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:45.840
roger: okay. This one seems to be able to toggle doing column, one and column 2 that can be common. I always been told to people that it wasn't. Actually, I always controlled them in 1 1

97
00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:52.880
we can go actually. I wasn't told if people didn't come, but I was content a little bit. I I was content to be able to have one.

98
00:09:53.190 --> 00:10:07.660
roger: and this one, as well as having the problems of being able to toggle between column, one and column 2. Okay. So we just took a quick peek. Here, let's let's get out of this and try another course.

99
00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:13.230
roger: It's it's any other one. I think, about it, but it's it's it's it's it's Still, even the for you.

100
00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:14.690
roger: The first course

101
00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:26.780
doesn't mean it's it's it's it's it's it's the only type of doesn't mean it's it's it's it's it's it's it's. It's really any other one, adding all two-parts of tales. We're not the testified by applications, or where people use this and technology, it's where I find Module to take the next phenomena that we'll be raised in 1.5. I'm like I'm. Just building the modules

102
00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.500
talking So it's like it's like it's like 2020.

103
00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.390
roger: Okay.

104
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:32.710
Thanks, everybody.

105
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:37.600
But it's a of descriptions over the context. Many when they'll probably cutting the free and they will know what to do.

106
00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:52.710
roger: Okay, i'm not going to test the columns here. We did that already.

107
00:10:55.470 --> 00:11:06.630
I mean it's a really difficult part of what's the only automated disabilities. I'll be back on that. I mean it's it's really doesn't it very well on that. It's like that. And that's what i'm like. I'm going to do what i'm like same failure. cutting the pre-existing disability, adding the 588

108
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:08.880
five-year-olds. On.

109
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:22.540
roger: Oh, that sounds like a typo. I can I say say the d I d I d that's Yup. Sorry guys gonna have to revisit that bad boy. That's not all activities is not spelled correctly.

110
00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.900
and the 5 0n the table that doesn't really doesn't. Add in the freezing disability. same paintings selectively

111
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:43.620
cutting the back on the kind of disability that it flags like I like to click on with the 5, like about the testimony of the

112
00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.750
roger: with a five-year-old like that. It's just really doesn't it please. The left

113
00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.530
510 t0 510 to the

114
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:55.780
roger: automated. Okay.

115
00:11:56.390 --> 00:12:03.870
roger: So i'm getting a five-year-old

116
00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.830
flags. My flag with your likes on with the 5 that comes about the testing disability course.

117
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:10.390
roger: Okay. So

118
00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:11.760
flags my colleagues on

119
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:13.940
roger: interesting

120
00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:18.320
roger: what I what I would suggest here.

121
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:23.420
roger: just so that the Screen reader user knows that there's new content.

122
00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:27.220
roger: Once they expand this button that it's like one of the

123
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.640
roger: that the new content will appear

124
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:36.130
roger: directly below. and i'm talking. Don't even put 5 activities done.

125
00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.770
roger: get rid of that, and just expand it.

126
00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:42.760
roger: because to kind of have that little hurdle.

127
00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:51.830
roger: and then find where the new content is. It's not always easy to conceptualize that and understand that

128
00:12:52.150 --> 00:13:00.740
about the same disability was Minnesota Wasn't it it's a We then adding the 5% to the I mean, that's a really interesting

129
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:08.580
roger: Okay? And then, now this is back to the original content on the page.

130
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:09.640
They were just.

131
00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:13.970
roger: but it's still it's a quiz, and none of these are linked. They're absolutely.

132
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.160
We don't know about the testing. It's really

133
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:22.210
roger: so. I mean, they almost seem like they are links. You can click on

134
00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:28.660
roger: based on the the verbiage.

135
00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:43.650
I mean it's it's really it's it's it's it's it's, it's, it's it's it's it's it's a make mechanism. To I mean it's it's it's a it's a that it will. It's like a adding with 2% of my doesn't mean that it's really I don't know if it's going to be the 5 by the candidate. 556 0n it's a five-year-old of the testimony. It's it's going to be a

136
00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:55.010
roger: i'm not sure again. I know that some items are not available. But

137
00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.100
roger: were they links?

138
00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:08.690
roger: Were they buttons that were? We're supposed to be defined that I could have selected because that's the impression that I got. What is accessibility testing, and I thought I would have been taken to a page or

139
00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:18.050
roger: a a modell, or something that would answer that question. Maybe it's already on this page, but I haven't gotten to it. It should really it shouldn't really take that much time to find it

140
00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:19.180
I can be able to.

141
00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:39.250
roger: So it's it's a it's like their mac that's the much right. There that they'll do activate the same page, and it's it's it's, it's, it's it's it's like they're in the next Testament right there that'll see in the phenomenon where it's a continuous integration. Graphic If it's a it's, it's, it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's, a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's, a it's, a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's, a it'

142
00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:40.070
our competitive.

143
00:14:54.290 --> 00:15:05.150
like the fact that there was an I like there. There's a customer's metaphor that it's a disability. So it's all that i's called much of any of we actually don't use with much of the testing framework. This link is actually one. For example, if there was an AD like there on the top tennis rates, and that's an example of forming with the label.

144
00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:09.670
roger: Okay.

145
00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.510
i'm like I mean it's a it's a that one.

146
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:16.800
roger: So this is automated accessibility

147
00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.910
like that's a disability like, what's it matter with the freedoms adding a to my club

148
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:28.290
with my

149
00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:33.090
roger: Let's get out of this one a lot of interesting things here, but

150
00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:48.490
roger: people can do things in an automated way. you know. They can only go so far because you need to also test the usability

151
00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:52.830
roger: of of that so called accessible website to see if it's

152
00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:56.870
roger: understandable by your average screen reader, for example, user or

153
00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:04.700
roger: other assistive technology. So in other words, you got to involve the human in it.

154
00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:08.040
roger: I'll just d0 0ne more. I people don't want me to just believe that it will be

155
00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:14.030
available to people with disabilities, and they will be unable to commit to the I people don't seem to.

156
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:20.460
roger: and let me just double check the page

157
00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:24.510
writing it up. I'm not able to list it to my resources for legacy disability.

158
00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:34.820
roger: Okay. I'm just trying to refresh my memory because all I did was use the back button. and I thought I was going to go back to the main page.

159
00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:48.840
roger: Okay, this might be the course. Yeah, I i'm just remembering. And I should have used the the breadcrum.

160
00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:50.560
roger: Let's try that.

161
00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:53.910
I just don't have a little bit of it for me. Let's make them

162
00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.840
roger: okay, metal. To

163
00:16:56.060 --> 00:17:09.630
I just don't have a problem with any other one. adding all 2 ports of tail. We're not a build that's like we're over there, and when people use this with technologies, because i'm 6 models that take 15 and 20B min to complete operation, so that we're actually going to be able to do it. But it's it's it's it's it's it's. It's it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's it's, it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's.

164
00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.680
roger: let's try it out.

165
00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:17.339
I just don't need to another one

166
00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:22.589
roger: accessible, I don't want to tell you that it it's like a new editor. I'm like

167
00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:32.190
same big link to the that you know. For example, Web development cutting the 556 0f the I don't know if it's a web development, adding the 5 0ne blocks of a web development 4 by 4 times I

168
00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:48.410
links to. But this link information about links. For example, when you specify a language link, you don't have to

169
00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:49.570
roger: Karen.

170
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:56.450
roger: I'm just trying to understand here. If this is still part of the side menu.

171
00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:09.630
We have a a quiz with that heading with 556 0f components 5 5 5 but it's cutting the 5 0n the left-handed, and you're g0 7. It's like it's it's it's it's it's it's it's, it's it's it's it's it's it's on my heading up to a desktop application man who's adding up to a testable permission man who's heading up to a table.

172
00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:10.860
So the authentic for you

173
00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:14.260
roger: i'm gonna back up to the top.

174
00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:17.610
recommending that to access to that little one that it will.

175
00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:30.050
roger: So this is a side menu that will do what I like. The thing that I don't understand is. How do you know when you're at the end of the side menu? Because

176
00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:33.530
there's a lot of headings here that you could use?

177
00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:40.410
roger: And it could be very misunderstood to think that you're actually on the main page.

178
00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:45.140
roger: So how do you that? That's my question is, how do you know you're done

179
00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:46.980
roger: with the with the side menu

180
00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:54.680
accessible development that we will for accessible development. That's much of a content that the 555 billionpounds that we'll be able to get int0 500 labs activated.

181
00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:05.730
roger: So I think a person would really need to have an understanding of what what's on this page and use it multiple times to be able to know

182
00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:11.780
roger: where they are sort of on the page. Let me go back up to the top

183
00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:16.980
navigation. We don't like that. Like what is it with that? Nobody to me that

184
00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:27.820
roger: so even the side menu is not not a I don't think it's a region mechanical navigation meeting with the Microsoft casualties.

185
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:33.130
metal navigation that you will do with them. No ready to stop me. So that's the thing it's like

186
00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:48.280
roger: You You say that it's a side menu. So i'm like, okay in my mind. It's like off to the side. But as I go through it I don't really conceptualize it as just a menu, and then. Now I'm. On the main

187
00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:51.750
roger: part of the course. So I definitely would say.

188
00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:56.400
roger: there's got to be a better way to delineate the content

189
00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:58.540
from the side menu.

190
00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:09.670
roger: from the content on the main page to understand. Hey, you know. this is what I want. Let me go to the side menu bam. Let me move over to the main part

191
00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:15.250
roger: so I can, you know, check it out. I think that would really help with the usability

192
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:27.820
roger: getting down to the nitty gritty of this content. I think it's about it like I mean I could. I could continue checking out other courses and other components of it, but

193
00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:38.220
roger: from the outset it just seems like, hey, Just go poke around randomly, check things out. Try them out and give us your feedback. and that's what I did. So

194
00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.330
roger: we saw that there were a couple of things that kinda

195
00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:45.270
roger: to me for a little loop there that didn't quite follow

196
00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:54.920
roger: well other things work really well with the regions and the headings. because, having something you you could conceptualize

197
00:20:55.150 --> 00:21:05.880
roger: and have a really good layout of how the page is. Allow me to move a little bit more efficiently on the page to get to the content that I want to get to and not really get lost in it.

198
00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:15.850
roger: just like what we saw. That button that I expanded. and I was still sitting on the button as opposed to the content that it expanded, and I have to go look for it.

199
00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:20.400
roger: There's a lot of question marks that come in my mind. It makes a little bit tougher

200
00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:29.760
roger: when a screen reader user has to hunt around kind of like an Easter egg hunt to find it. Okay? Well, I I expanded this button. Where's the content now of it.

201
00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:43.460
roger: So number one. Thank you so much for developing the content of these pages and courses because they're super super super important. I hope you get a lot of traffic and a lot of use out of them.

202
00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.400
roger: But at the same time, if you did have

203
00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:58.900
roger: consumers who were assistive technology users that you were able to address some of the things that I mentioned to you to make it a little bit more worthwhile like for us, because I can definitely learn a lot from the content that you've

204
00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:00.240
roger: based on here.

205
00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:03.050
roger: Thanks, everyone. Take good care, bye. Now.
