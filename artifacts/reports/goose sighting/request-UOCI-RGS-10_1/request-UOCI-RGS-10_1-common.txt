issue_title: Mislabeling of the Continue Button
description: Caitlin expressed confusion regarding the labeling of the 'Continue' button on the submission page, suggesting that it should be labeled 'Submit' to accurately reflect the action being taken. The label 'Continue' implied that there was more to the application process, which was not the case.
