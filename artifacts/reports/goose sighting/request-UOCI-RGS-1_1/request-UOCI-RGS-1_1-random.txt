issue_title: Screen Reader Navigation Issue
description: The tester experienced a navigation issue where the tab key did not move focus to the 'Continue' button as expected. The tester knew the button was there but had to manually switch out of focus mode to find and activate it. This indicates a potential focus management problem that could disorient screen reader users and hinder their ability to proceed through the form.
