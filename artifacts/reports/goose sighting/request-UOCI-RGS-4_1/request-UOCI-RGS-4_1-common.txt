issue_title: Inconsistent Heading Levels
description: Doug noticed that the page skipped from a heading level one to a heading level three, which can be confusing for screen reader users who rely on a logical order of headings to navigate content. This violates the expected heading hierarchy, making it difficult to understand the structure and flow of the page.
