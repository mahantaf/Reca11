issue_title: Confusing Main Screen and Lack of Guidance
description: Marina finds the main screen confusing as it seems to imply that there is already a budget plan in place, and there is no clear guidance on how to set up a budget, including adding income or categories before expenses. This lack of guidance can be particularly challenging for first-time users.

issue_title: Ineffective color coding for screen reader users

description: Marina found that the chart data in the budget analysis was not conveyed effectively to her as a screen reader user.
