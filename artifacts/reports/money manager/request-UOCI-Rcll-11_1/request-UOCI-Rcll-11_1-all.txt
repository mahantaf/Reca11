timestamps: '00:34:41.989 --> 00:34:57.770'

description: The monthly expenses analysis appeared to be an empty web document, as TalkBack did not read any content within it, and swiping right returned to the previous screen. This made it impossible for Matt to access the analysis information.
timestamps: '00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:59.030'
