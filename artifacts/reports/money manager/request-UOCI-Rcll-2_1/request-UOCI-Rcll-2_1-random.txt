issue_title: Screen Reader Navigation Issues
description: The user, Ben, seems to be having trouble navigating the app with the screen reader. There are repeated instances where Ben is trying to find and interact with elements such as 'budget category', 'open navigation', and 'more options', but there is no clear indication that the screen reader is effectively guiding him through the app's interface. This suggests that the focus management for the screen reader is not working as expected, causing disorientation and difficulty in completing tasks.
