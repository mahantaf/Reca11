issue_title: Repeated Misinterpretation of UI Elements
description: The screen reader repeatedly misinterprets UI elements, causing confusion. The user is trying to navigate through the application, but the screen reader is not providing clear or accurate information about the UI elements, such as buttons and headings. This makes it difficult for the user to understand the structure of the page and to perform actions like logging in or accessing different parts of the application.

issue_title: Screen Reader Navigation Issues
description: Geza, the user, reports difficulty with screen reader navigation. When navigating through headings, the screen reader cursor jumps to the top of the page instead of following the logical flow. This behavior can disorient users who rely on screen readers to understand the structure and navigate the content of the page.
timestamps: '00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:28.949'

issue_title: Autocomplete Interference with Screen Reader
description: Kristen mentions that the autocomplete feature is interfering with the screen reader's ability to read the content. This can be problematic as it may cause confusion or prevent the screen reader from accurately conveying the information on the screen to the user.
timestamps: '00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:18.859'

issue_title: Confusing Navigation and Labeling
description: Geza, the tester, encountered issues with confusing navigation and labeling. The screen reader output was not clear, and the tester had to rely on guesswork to understand the structure of the page. This was evident when Geza was trying to navigate using headings and regions but found the process unclear and disjointed. The tester also mentioned the use of a 'same page link' which did not seem to function as expected, leading to further confusion.
timestamps: '00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:12.729', '00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:36.189', '00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:12.889', '00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:40.170', '00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:04.390', '00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:18.700', '00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:40.589', '00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:12.540', '00:34:24.489 --> 00:34:40.589', '00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:15.089', '00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:37.600', '00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:21.280', '00:37:41.730 --> 00:40:57.360', '00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:04.889', '00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:42.759', '00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:32.449', '00:43:13.110 --> 00:43:22.289'

issue_title: Inconsistent Region Navigation
description: The tester, Geza, struggled with navigating the page using regions. The regions did not seem to be coded properly, as they did not start at the heading and did not automatically read out the content underneath each region. This made it difficult for the tester to understand the structure and content of the page, as they had to manually navigate to each region and then explore its contents.
timestamps: '00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:37.600', '00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:21.280', '00:37:41.730 --> 00:40:57.360', '00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:04.889', '00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:42.759', '00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:32.449'

issue_title: Search Function Accessibility
description: Geza experienced difficulty with the search function. The screen reader did not clearly announce the search box, and the tester had to use shortcut keys to locate it. Additionally, the labels for the search and filter buttons were not clear, which could lead to confusion when trying to perform a search.
timestamps: '00:43:13.110 --> 00:43:22.289', '00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:34.290', '00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:45.679', '00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:18.339'

issue_title: Search Functionality Accessibility Issue
description: Geza encountered an issue with the search functionality. After performing a search, the screen reader did not announce the search results, nor did it automatically navigate to the results. This left Geza uncertain if the search had been executed properly, as there was no audible confirmation or jump to the relevant section.
timestamps: '00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:57.859', '00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:02.690'

issue_title: Filter Function Accessibility Issue
description: Geza experienced a problem with the filter function. After applying filters, the headings on the page were no longer recognized by the screen reader, which prevented Geza from navigating the filtered results efficiently. This issue forced Geza to read more details and navigate by list, which was less efficient than using headings.
timestamps: '00:50:23.770 --> 00:50:38.890', '00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:51.390'

issue_title: Inconsistent Shortcut Key Usage
description: Geza reported that different shortcut keys were required to navigate lists and headings, which can be confusing and inefficient. Geza prefers using headings for navigation as it is faster, but when the content is presented as a list, more details need to be read, slowing down the navigation process.
timestamps: '00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:59.790'

issue_title: Lack of Audible Notifications for Search Results
description: Geza noted that after conducting a search, there was no audible notification to indicate that the search had been performed or that results had been found. This lack of feedback can leave users uncertain about the status of their actions.
timestamps: '00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:57.859'

issue_title: Unclear Button Labels
description: Kristen reports that the buttons on the application are not labeled clearly. She emphasizes the importance of having buttons labeled properly, especially for navigation purposes such as play, forward, or backward. Without clear labels, she is unsure of what actions she is performing when clicking on them.
timestamps: '00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:53.289', '00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:58.120'

issue_title: Loss of Filter Settings on Refresh
description: Kristen mentions that when she applies filters in the search function, they work, but if she refreshes the page, the filters are lost and have to be set up again. This issue indicates a lack of persistence in user settings, which can be frustrating and inefficient for users, especially those using assistive technologies.
timestamps: '01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:33.480'
