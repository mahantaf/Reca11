issue_title: Inconsistent Region Order
description: Roger expressed confusion about the order of regions on the page, as they did not match his expectations based on typical web layouts. He expected the banner to come before the navigation region, followed by the main region, but found that the main region came first. This disoriented him and made the page layout seem counterintuitive.
