issue_title: Skip to Main Content Link Not Functional

issue_title: Table Navigation Issues
description: Roger experienced difficulty navigating a table with his screen reader. He was only able to toggle within one column and could not move to the second column despite invoking the command to do so. This suggests a problem with the table structure or labeling.

issue_title: Content Expansion Not Announced to Screen Reader
description: Roger expressed difficulty with a button that, when expanded, did not announce the new content or move focus to it. This left him sitting on the button, having to search for the expanded content, which was not an efficient or clear experience.

issue_title: Unclear Side Menu Navigation
description: Roger was confused about the delineation between the side menu and the main content. He found it difficult to conceptualize when he had reached the end of the side menu and was on the main page, suggesting a need for a clearer way to differentiate between these sections.
timestamps: '00:18:14.430 --> 00:20:09.670'

issue_title: Inconsistent Labeling and Functionality
description: Roger encountered elements that seemed like they should be links or buttons based on their wording, but their actual functionality was unclear. He expected to be taken to a new page or modal but was unable to determine if these were interactive elements or not.
timestamps: '00:13:15.480 --> 00:14:18.050'
