issue_title: Voice Commands Not Recognized
description: George encountered an issue where the software did not recognize multiple voice commands when trying to interact with the 'Get Started' button. Despite repeated attempts with different phrasings such as 'click next', 'click star tour on', 'click! Get started', and 'but get started', the application failed to respond, forcing George to resort to using the mouse grid command, which is a less efficient method for him.
