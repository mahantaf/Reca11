issue_title: Difficulty interacting with video controls
description: Hassan struggled to interact with video controls using voice commands. The controls would disappear after hovering over the video, making it difficult to bring them back up with the 'show links' command. He suggests that the controls should always be visible to facilitate voice interaction.

issue_title: Video Full Screen Exit Issue
description: Hassan reports that when exiting full-screen mode on a video by saying 'press escape,' the page scrolls back to the top rather than staying focused on the video. This makes it difficult to navigate back to the video using voice commands alone, as the mouse cursor may not be hovering over the video after exiting full screen.

issue_title: Video Control Accessibility
description: Hassan found that the video controls disappear after a few seconds, which makes it difficult to use voice commands to interact with them. He suggests that keeping the controls visible for a longer period would be helpful, as he had to memorize the numbers corresponding to the controls to interact with them using voice commands.

issue_title: Controls Disappear Too Quickly for Voice Control Users
description: Hassan reported that the controls disappear after a certain amount of time, which can cause confusion for people using voice control. He suggests that the controls should either be permanent or should not disappear too quickly to allow voice control users to easily turn them on or off at will.
