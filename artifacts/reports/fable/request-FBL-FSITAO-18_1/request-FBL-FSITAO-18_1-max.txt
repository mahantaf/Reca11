issue_title: Image and Text Clarity at High Magnification
description: The tester reported that at 500% magnification, the image of the badge becomes blurry, and the 'download' text also appears blurry. This indicates a need for higher resolution images and clearer font rendering at high levels of magnification to ensure readability and visual clarity for magnification users.
