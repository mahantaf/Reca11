issue_title: Inconsistent Heading Structure
description: Palmer encountered issues with inconsistent heading structures, which made it difficult to navigate to the desired content using headings. This was particularly evident when trying to locate the bookmarking functionality, as it was not immediately apparent under the headings and required extensive navigation to find.
