issue_title: Voice Commands Not Working as Expected
description: Tariel experienced difficulty with voice commands not working as expected. Despite attempting to use the 'show links' command to navigate to the email input field, Tariel had to resort to using 'mouse grid' and other commands to interact with the page. This indicates a potential issue with voice command recognition or the software's ability to respond to these commands, which can hinder the accessibility for users relying on voice navigation.

issue_title: Difficulty with Dictation and Spelling Out Password
description: Tariel struggled with dictating the password, having to correct mistakes multiple times ('scratch that') and manually navigate the cursor ('move left one', 'move right'). This suggests that the dictation feature may not be accurately capturing voice input, leading to a cumbersome and potentially frustrating experience for users who cannot use a keyboard.

issue_title: Inconsistent Interaction with Links
description: Tariel encountered issues when trying to interact with links using voice commands. The 'click' command did not always work, and Tariel had to use alternative methods like 'mouse grid' to select links. This inconsistency can cause confusion and inefficiency for users who depend on voice commands for navigation.
