issue_title: Focus Management Issue
description: Andrew reports that after activating a link, the focus did not move as expected. This occurred multiple times, such as when using the 'Skip to main content' link and when activating the 'About the Web Development Course' link. The focus remained in the same spot, causing confusion and requiring additional navigation to find the correct location.

issue_title: Video Player Controls Disappear
description: Andrew encountered a significant issue where the controls for the video player disappeared after hitting the play button. This prevented him from being able to pause, stop, or interact with the video in any way, which could be problematic if he needed to take a break or received a phone call.

issue_title: Inconsistent Navigation and Labeling
description: Andrew found that navigating through the course content was inconsistent. He expected to be taken to the main activity section but was instead taken past the beginning parts. Additionally, the headings and buttons were not labeled in a way that made it clear what content they were associated with, leading to confusion.

issue_title: Screen reader repeating bullet items
description: Andrew experienced an issue where the screen reader seemed to read the same bullet a couple of times as if they were separate items, which could indicate a problem with how the list items are structured or tagged for screen reader interpretation.
timestamps: '00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:38.859', '00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:42.080'

issue_title: Inconsistent heading structure
description: Andrew noticed that the heading structure was not consistent, as he had to use a shortcut key to detect headings that the screen reader did not automatically identify. This inconsistency can lead to confusion and difficulty in navigating the content.
timestamps: '00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:27.369'

issue_title: Video player controls disappearing
description: Andrew reported that every time he hit play on a video, the controls would disappear until he refreshed the page with F5. This behavior could be due to an integration issue with the video hosting service (Vimeo) and affects the ability to control video playback.

issue_title: Screen reader focus issues
description: Andrew mentioned that after refreshing the page, the screen reader's focus was on the play button, but he expected it to be at the top of the page. This unexpected focus placement can disorient users.
timestamps: '00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:30.799'

issue_title: Repetitive reading of list items
description: The screen reader was reading the same list item multiple times when Andrew was navigating by bullet points, which could indicate an issue with how the list is coded or presented to the screen reader.
timestamps: '00:29:40.090 --> 00:30:01.410'

issue_title: Inconsistent Heading Structure
description: Andrew expressed confusion due to inconsistent heading structures, which made it difficult to determine if he was in the final section of the module or just another part of it. He expected a clear indication, such as a quiz or a distinct pause point, to signify the end of a module.
timestamps: '00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:45.070', '00:32:53.060 --> 00:33:15.529'

timestamps: '00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:17.170'
