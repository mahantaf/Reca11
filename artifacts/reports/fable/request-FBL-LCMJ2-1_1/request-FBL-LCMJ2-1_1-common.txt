issue_title: Video Player Controls Disappear After Playing Video
description: After activating the play button on a video, Andrew found that the controls for the video player disappeared, making it impossible to pause or interact with the video further.

issue_title: Inconsistent Heading Structure
description: Andrew expressed confusion due to inconsistent heading structures, which made it difficult to determine if he was in the final section of the module or just another part of it. He expected a clear indication, such as a quiz or a distinct pause point, to signify the end of a module.
